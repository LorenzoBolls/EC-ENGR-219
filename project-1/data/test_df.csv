"'A small patch of snow on the ground in Douai, in Hauts de France

French weather forecasters are going on strike over their ousting by algorithms that predicted a heatwave in freezing Strasbourg this week.

Three unions at Météo-France said they would down tools starting on Monday until Jan 7 because of the increasing reliance on a new forecast system called 3P “that gives pride of place to automation” according to Jérôme Lartisant, the head of the FO union.

The FO union, along with Solidaires-Météo and SNM-CGT, said that, barring major weather warnings, automated bulletins and forecasts were no longer systematically supervised by humans, and could be published “as they are”.

Since Nov 13, weather forecast data models have been crunched together via an algorithm and then directly sent to Météo-France’s internet site or mobile application.

The software that has led to the strike has predicted that the eastern city of Strasbourg will hit a baking 28C on Dec 9 despite it currently experiencing freezing temperatures.

‘A whole load of failings’

The FO union published the error on X, formerly Twitter, to “illustrate the errors of this forecasting chain, which is not yet complete but which has been declared operational because there are no forecasters to keep doing the job”.

“There are far fewer human interventions and proofreaders,” said François Giroux, the CGT national manager for regional channel France 3. “We’ve seen errors in the forecasts. We have customers who are not happy and who are calling us to tell us about it.”

He added: “This data includes absurd mistakes, forecasts of temperatures of 28 degrees in Brittany in November, forecasts of snow when temperatures are at 10 degrees – a whole load of failings that our organisation isn’t able to correct.”

Unions have blamed staff cuts for the debacle. Mr Lartisant told Libération that previously, “seven people assessed supercomputer bulletins, one for each major region, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. With the new organisation, there is now just one person in charge of this”.

Liénor Feuga, of Solidaires-Météo, told France Inter radio: “In the past 15 years, Météo-France has lost around a third of its staff and this shift (to the automated system) has taken place due to a lack of human resources when the tools were clearly not ready for this change.”

She added: “Forecasters are suffering immensely and it sends a catastrophic image whereas we claim to be an organisation that is on the absolute cutting edge in the field of forecasting.”

Météo-France management says it has entered talks with unions over the issue and that it is confident that any outstanding “bugs” will swiftly be ironed out.

‘This is a hugely exciting technology’

The strike comes less than a month after reports that a new AI model created by Google DeepMind can produce precise forecasts in less than a minute, after being trained on 40 years of meteorological data from weather stations, satellite images and radar records.

GraphCast has already shown it can identify extreme weather events much sooner, spotting Hurricane Lee would make landfall in Nova Scotia nine days before it hit in September – three days earlier than traditional forecasts.

Unlike traditional models which rely on running current conditions through physics equations and computer algorithms, the new programme uses a neural network to learn how the atmosphere evolves over time.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Matthew Chantry, machine learning co-ordinator at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, which is already using the program, said: “In the last 18 months, we’ve seen the emergence of a new possibility for making weather forecasts directly with machine learning models.

“This is a hugely exciting technology. It is likely the beginning of a revolution in how our weather forecasts are created.”

LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia's soccer body announced on Tuesday the signing of Brazilian coach Antonio Carlos Zago to seek a comeback in South American World Cup qualifying after four matches. He will replace Gustavo Costas, who was fired last week.

Zago, a former defender at Roma and several Brazilian clubs, is taking over shortly before two rounds of the round-robin competition in November. He was introduced by the head of Bolivia's soccer federation, Fernando Costa.

Bolivia has zero points after four rounds. It will take on Peru at home on Nov. 16 and then play at Uruguay five days later.

“I am proud to defend this country. We have to start adding points and get a better position,” the 54-year-old Zago said in a news conference. Last year, he won the Bolivian championship as coach of Bolivar.

The next World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada is expanding to a 48-team format, meaning direct entry to the top six teams in South America. The seventh-place team will contest an intercontinental playoff for a berth.

"'NEW YORK >> The Las Vegas Aces became the first team in 21 years to win back-to-back WNBA championships, getting 24 points and 16 rebounds from A’ja Wilson and a defensive stop in the closing seconds to beat the New York Liberty 70-69 in Game 4 of the Finals on Wednesday night.

The Aces joined the Los Angeles Sparks (2001-02) and the Houston Comets (1997-2000) as the only teams in league history to win consecutive titles.

Las Vegas did it without starters Chelsea Gray and Kiah Stokes, who were both sidelined with foot injuries suffered in Game 3. Gray, the 2022 WNBA Finals MVP, was constantly in the ear of her teammates during timeouts and shouting encouragement from the sideline. Las Vegas was also still missing veteran Candace Parker, who had foot surgery in late July.

Wilson won Finals MVP honors this year after finishing in third in the regular-season MVP balloting.

With the game tied at 64, Jackie Young scored four straight points to give the Aces a 68-64 advantage with 2:04 left.

New York’s Breanna Stewart got an open look at 3 but the shot rimmed out. Wilson then hit a tough turnaround shot with 1:26 left to give the Aces a 70-64 advantage.

Courtney Vandersloot hit a 3-pointer on New York’s next possession, then stole the ball from Kelsey Plum, which led to Sabrina Ionescu’s foul-line jumper to get the Liberty within one with 41.7 left.

On the ensuing possession, Las Vegas worked the shot clock down before coach Becky Hammon called timeout with 3 seconds left on the shot clock. The Aces got the ball to Wilson on a lob, but Stewart blocked the shot, giving New York one last chance.

After a timeout with 8.8 seconds left, the Liberty got the ball to Stewart, who was double-teamed. The ball swung over to Vandersloot in the corner, but her shot missed badly, setting off a wild celebration by the Aces at midcourt.

Vandersloot finished with 19 points and Betnijah Laney added 15 for New York.

Hammon said before the game she would be “throwing the kitchen sink at (the Liberty), see what sticks, see what works.”

The Aces rotated defenses, which stymied New York after the Liberty scored 23 points in the first quarter. Hammon started WNBA sixth woman of the year Alysha Clark and Cayla George in place of Gray and Stokes. Clark did a stellar job on her former Seattle Storm teammate Stewart, holding her to 10 points on 3-of-17 shooting. George had 11 points.

This was the first close game of the season between these teams. The four regular-season matchups were all blowouts with the closest contest being a nine-point win by New York on Aug. 28. The first three games of the WNBA Finals were also routs, with New York winning Game 3 87-73 to stave off elimination.

Game 4 was so tense that Ionescu was seen vomiting into a trash can during a timeout midway through the fourth quarter, shortly after she hit a 3-pointer to get the Liberty within 60-58. Ionescu returned to the court after the timeout.'",sports,basketball

"'The City of Watertown is currently under a water emergency.

MORE:

A single burst pipe has led to three reservoirs losing all their water, leaving residents without access to drinking, cleaning, or cooking water.

CNY Central went to the site of the pipe burst in Watertown and has learned how long people will have to endure this water shortage.



The water pipe broke early Thursday morning, causing residents in Watertown to be without their regular water supply.

At a press conference, the City of Watertown expressed concern that this may not be the last pipe to break. The specific location of the burst pipe is Huntington Street and Eastern Boulevard, resulting in a complete loss of water supply for the city.



Engineers believe that wear and tear on the 50-60-year-old pipes contributed to the pipe's failure. Repairs are currently underway, but officials warn that access to running water could be unavailable for several days.

""The timeline is that we are hoping by Saturday, Sunday at the latest, the reservoirs and the systems will be filled, and then another two to three days after that, you will have to boil water,” said Watertown Mayor Jeffrey Smith.

An even more significant concern is a potential pressure issue. Once the new pipe is fixed and pressurized into the system, Mayor Smith has pointed out that this may lead to the potential for other old pipes to break, causing further delays in water restoration.

But how does the breaking of one pipe impact the entire city? This particular pipe is crucial, as it carries water from the Black River, which runs through Watertown, to the three reservoirs in the city.

""You couldn't have asked for a worse section of pipe; it's literally right off the water treatment plant, and just because of the pressure, it seems once it bursts, the valves that shut it off because of the backflow have failed. It's the worst place you could probably have a break because it affects the whole system,” said Smith

To address this crisis, the Department of Homeland Security, along with the State of New York, has established three different areas for residents to obtain water. These sites are located at the Fairgrounds Ice Arena, Watertown High School and the Northland Plaza.

""My opinion is when you have specific pipes that do this job and feed the entire city, they need to be looked at on a regular basis. Put a camera down the pipe to see what it looks like from the inside,” said Dominick Vallone, who was at the Watertown High School waiting for water to be delivered to the school.

The hole that resulted from the pipe failure is being filled in, but it will still be some time before running water is fully restored. New York State is currently distributing 32,000 gallons of drinking water for Watertown residents, available at any of the three designated water distribution sites in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security, along with the state of New York said that when residents do get running water back, they should boil it before use.

Genre: Historical biopic

Run time: 3h

Director: Christopher Nolan

Cast: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon

Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” in Christopher Nolan’s biopic chronicling the scientist’s tenure at a clandestine research facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico to his embattled reputation and public disgrace in years following World War 2.

From our review,

In its final stretch, Oppenheimer uses the political campaign to discredit the physicist and unpick his legacy as a way to get under the skin of a man whose stance on his awful creation remained contradictory and enigmatic. After the overpowering bomb sequences, that’s a surprisingly subtle and complex tack for Nolan to take, but it works because the story is driven by the historical record and the characters, rather than by dogma, with the appalling moral consequences emerging naturally from the details. Nolan is not one to let any member of the audience miss his point, and the film’s final scene does ram it home. But first, he builds out the web of ambition, compromise, dreams, politics, jealousy, and inspiration — in a word, humanity — that unleashed the forces he stands in awe of. In Oppenheimer, man is the most dreadful machine of all.

"'MAGOFFIN COUNTY, Ky. (WKYT) - Forest fire season is in full swing in the Bluegrass. Multiple fires burned over the weekend, forcing the Division of Forestry to implement their emergency response plan.

“We had three active fires yesterday, and two of them are still active today that the division of forestry is still out on,” said Fire Chief Paul Howard, Salyersville Fire Department.

While the current weather conditions are conducive to the spreading of forest fires, the Division of Forestry says that 99% of all wildland fires in the state are caused by humans. Over 50% of those fires are attributed to arson, making it the leading cause of forest fires in Kentucky.

Steve Kull, an environmental consultant with the Kentucky Division of Forestry, said arson is “actually defined in statute as setting fire on land owned by another. And it describes, wantonly, maliciously, but basically deliberately causing another person’s land to have a fire.”

We’re told 288 fires this year, so far, have been officially declared as arson. Intentionally setting fire is a felony under state law and is punishable by up to five years in prison or up to $10,000 in fines.

Kull went on to say, “It’s important that we find where it started, then we can move to how it started. Then we can further try to determine if there is footprints or if someone up there is involved or what was used to do it, maybe if they have left something behind.”

With a little over 30 days left in forest fire season, officials are urging folks to abide by the burn bans and make sure any fires are completely out in order to keep folks safe.

“Help us out,” Howard said, “Don’t put fires out that are going to spread and stuff cause you know we got limited resources, and we aren’t able to go everywhere in the spur of the moment.”

“Quicker we find out about a fire, the quicker we can report to it. Hopefully, we have crews available. And report any arson activity you may see,” said Kull.

During our fall fire season, it is illegal to burn anything within 150 feet of any woodland or brushland between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Additional red flag warnings will also be placed for counties at greater risk during fire season.

"'Flood zone rewrite threatens to sock homeowners

A flooded neighborhood in Merced, Calif., in January. | Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images

A federal panel is urging the government to expand the areas it considers at high risk of flooding — potentially requiring millions of homeowners to buy flood insurance for the first time.

The move comes as flood damage has soared in recent years, leading to costly disasters even in states like Kentucky and Vermont that were once considered relatively safe.

Remaking the maps would be far-reaching and expensive because owners would be required to buy flood coverage if their property is secured by a federally backed mortgage, writes Thomas Frank, who obtained a copy of the panel’s report. Coverage averages about $1,000 a year, but prices are rising rapidly as climate change and increasing development intensify flood damage.

“This adjustment would be a significant shock,” Jeremy Porter, a researcher at the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit that assesses climate risk, told Tom.

Only a small fraction of U.S. households have flood policies, which are sold separately from homeowners insurance. Expanding the flood insurance requirement could upend housing markets by increasing the cost of ownership. But it could also protect millions who face rising flood risk.

The National Association of Home Builders is already raising concern about the costs, noting the proposal to expand the map comes as many communities face housing shortages.

Political risk

The Federal Emergency Management Agency can redefine flood zones on its own, but any expansion would likely draw congressional scrutiny.

FEMA — which runs the nation’s largest flood insurance program — is already facing a torrent of complaints about rising flood insurance premiums from coastal lawmakers, including from Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who was just elected House speaker by the Republican majority.

About 8.5 million properties are in areas the federal government considers at high risk of flooding. Experts believe more than twice as many are actually at risk.

The expansion is recommended in an interim report by the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, which Congress created in 2012 to strengthen the flood program against challenges such as climate change. It aims to address problems with the maps, which have been criticized for excluding large swaths of flood-prone areas.

More homeowners would be financially covered with an expanded map, said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers.

“Insurance is always a front-line protection,” he said.

GOP mulls a carbon tariff

When is a tariff not a tax? Republican senators are trying to sell the idea that a carbon tariff on foreign importers won’t lead to a similar levy for U.S. companies.

Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy is sponsoring a resolution that rejects the idea of a carbon tax. It’s meant to set the stage for proposed legislation that would impose a tariff on carbon-intensive imported goods.

The legislative two-step underscores a political minefield ahead for Republicans, write Emma Dumain and Kelsey Brugger.

Rebranding ‘green’

States grappling to reach goals for renewables and emissions cuts from the power sector are rebranding what counts as “clean,” writes Zach Bright.

In the North Carolina Legislature, for example, the state’s Republican supermajority overrode the governor’s veto to force through a law to rebrand nuclear as clean in the state energy mandate. Similar measures that symbolically or legally redefine natural gas and biomass as “clean,” “green” or “renewable” also passed this year in Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia.

Flash flood warning: Take action!

A flash flood warning is issued when a flash flood is either imminent or already occurring. In flood-prone areas, it's crucial to move immediately to higher ground. A flash flood is a sudden and violent inundation that can develop within minutes to hours, and it can even happen in areas not currently experiencing rainfall.

A flood warning is issued when flooding is imminent or occurring.

Flood advisory: Be aware:

A flood advisory is issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning. However, it may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, it could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property.

Flood watch: Be prepared:

A flood watch is issued when conditions are favorable for flooding. It doesn't guarantee that flooding will occur, but it signifies that the possibility exists.

When floods strike: Guidelines from the weather service for your protection

Floods can pose a significant threat, especially if you live in a flood-prone area or find yourself camping in a low-lying region. To ensure your safety, the weather service offers essential flood safety guidelines:

1. Move to higher ground:

If you're in a flood-prone area, or if you're camping in a low-lying spot, move to higher ground as a first step.

2. Follow evacuation orders:

If local authorities issue an evacuation order, heed it promptly. Prior to leaving, secure your home by locking it.

3. Disconnect utilities and appliances:

If time allows, disconnect your utilities and appliances. This reduces the risk of electrical hazards during flooding.

4. Avoid basements and submerged areas:

Steer clear of basements or rooms where water has submerged electrical outlets or cords. This helps prevent electrical accidents.

5. Evacuate promptly for safety:

If you notice sparks or hear buzzing, crackling, snapping, or popping noises, evacuate immediately. Avoid any water that may be charged with electricity.

6. Refrain from walking in floodwaters:

Never attempt to walk through floodwaters, even if they appear shallow. Just 6 inches of fast-moving water can forcefully sweep you off your feet.

7. Seek high ground if trapped:

Should you become trapped by moving water, reach the highest point possible and dial 911 to contact emergency services.

When heavy rain occurs, there is a potential for flooding, particularly in areas that are low-lying or prone to floods. It is crucial to never drive through water on the road, even if it appears shallow. According to the NWS, as little as 12 inches of fast-flowing water can carry away most vehicles. Prioritize your safety by staying informed and prepared.

Mastering wet roads: Safety tips for heavy rainfall

When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain:

Beware of rapid water flow:

In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger.

Maintain safe driving distances:

Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness.

Slow down and drive with care:

On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding.

Choose your lane wisely:

Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water.

Visibility matters:

Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them.

Watch out for slippery roads:

The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period.

Keep a safe distance from large vehicles:

Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely.

Mind your windshield wipers:

Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots.

When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position.

By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

"'The Greater Grenada Partnership has announced its strategic collaboration with Highland Grenada LLC, marking its largest capital investment industrial project in the organization’s history with a timber-related business.

Highland Grenada, an affiliate of Highlands Pellets LLC, set its sights on Grenada with the acquisition of the former GP OSB site — a 144-acre expanse that will soon become the city’s inaugural green energy project and wood pellet producer.

Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson, a longtime advocate of expanding the state’s timber industry, welcomes the collaboration.

“I applaud the effort of the Greater Grenada Partnership in bringing Highland Timber, LLC to the state of Mississippi,” Gipson said. “Timber is the leading agricultural commodity in over half of Mississippi counties and is the third largest commodity in the state, so I am excited to hear of further growth in our timber industry.”

The Highland Group, based in Arkansas, has a proven track record of responsibly deriving wood fiber from sources such as forest thinning and residual waste wood provided by local sawmills.

Removing smaller trees to prevent overcrowding and improve forest health, or thinning, is a vital component for long-term forest fire prevention and healthy forests. The practice not only aids in the long-term health and vitality of the forests but also contributes to the local economy by creating jobs and supporting the wider forestry economy.

Beyond environmental conservation, Highland actively engages with local communities by creating employment opportunities and sourcing quality pulpwood from local landowners, supporting the wider forestry economy, including loggers, truckers, rail workers, and landowners.

The wood pellets produced will be efficiently transported by train to nearby rail spurs, rivers, and ports. This optimized transport network not only reduces emissions but also facilitates the timely delivery of high-specification pellets to global markets, positioning Grenada as a responsible and dependable supplier of fuel for renewable energy.'",climate,forest fire

"'Climate change is making bad hurricanes more intense and increasing the amount of rain that storms dump on the Midwest. And in the coming decades, researchers say millions more people will decide it is too much to live with and leave.

In the first two decades of the 21st century, the threat of flooding persuaded more than 7 million people to avoid risky areas or abandon places that were risky, according to a paper Monday in the journal Nature Communications and research by the risk analysis organization First Street Foundation.

ST. LOUIS — Flooding is driving millions of people to move out of their homes, limiting growth in some prospering communities and accelerating the decline of others, according to a new study that details how climate change and flooding are transforming where Americans live.

First Street found that climate change is creating winners and losers at the neighborhood and block level.

Zoom out to consider the whole country and Americans appear to be ignoring the threat of climate change when they decide where to live. Florida, vulnerable to rising seas and strong storms, is growing fast, for example. But that misses an important way people behave locally. Most moves are short distance; people stay near family, friends, and jobs.

Jeremy Porter, head of research at First Street, said, “there’s more to the story” than population gains in Sun Belt states.

“People want to live in Miami. If you live in Miami already, you’re not going to say, ’Oh, this property is a 9 (out of 10 for flood risk), let me move to Denver,’” Porter said. “They are going to say, ‘This property is a 9, but I want to live in Miami, so I’m going to look for a 6 or a 7 or a 5 in Miami.’ You are going to think about relative risk.”

That’s what First Street projects over the next three decades: Blocks in Miami with a high chance of getting hit by a bad storm are more likely to see their population drop even though a lot of the city is expected to absorb more people.

Behind these findings is very detailed data about flood risk, population trends, and the reasons people move, allowing researchers to isolate the impact of flooding even though local economic conditions and other factors motivate families to pick up and live somewhere else. They analyzed population changes in very small areas, down to the census block.

Some blocks have grown fast and would have grown even faster if flooding wasn’t a problem, according to First Street. Expanding but flood-prone places could have grown nearly 25 percent more — attracting about 4.1 million more people — if that risk were lower. Researchers also identified areas where flood risk is driving or worsening population decline, which they called “climate abandonment areas.” About 3.2 million people left these neighborhoods because of flood risk over a two-decade span.

When First Street projected out to 2053, many of the new climate abandonment areas were in Michigan, Indiana, and other parts of the Midwest. Flood risk is just one factor driving this change and it doesn’t mean communities are emptying out, said Philip Mulder, a professor focused on risk and insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

“People can live in smarter places within those communities. That's just as true for Detroit as it is for Miami,” he said.

When people know a home is prone to flooding, they are less likely to buy it. Some states, however, don't require that flood history be disclosed, according to Joel Scata, a senior attorney on the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate adaptation team.

“Access to good information is really important in the real estate market,” Scata said.

Even for people who get assistance to move, the choice can be excruciating. Socastee, a community near Myrtle Beach, S.C., flooded not only when hurricanes hit, but sometimes just when it rained hard and water would reach doorways and saturate yards. First Street’s data says Horry County won’t grow quite as fast over the next three decades because of flood risk.

One resident who endured repeated flooding said it “makes you sick” with worry whenever it storms and rips away your sense of security.

Terri Straka decided to move from the area but had a hard time persuading her parents to do the same. Eventually, she brought them to a house for sale and said it could be their dream home. They reluctantly agreed to move.

“Them being able to visualize what a future might look like is absolutely critical to people being able to move. They have to imagine a place and it needs to be a real place that they can afford,” said Harriet Festing, executive director of Anthropocene Alliance which supports communities like Socastee hit by disaster and climate change.

There were also winners. Louisville, Detroit, and Chicago, as well as several other big cities, have a lot of space with little flood risk, which will be attractive in the future, First Street found.

The University of Wisconsin’s Mulder said of cities like Chicago: “They shouldn’t discount their relative benefits that will come from being a safer place in a warming world.”'",climate,flood
"'LOS ANGELES — Sparks head coach Curt Miller is the right person to bring the franchise their first No. 1 pick since 2012 on Sunday because he’s the team’s good luck charm, according to the team’s chief administrative officer and general manager Karen Bryant.

“He is our leader on the court,” Bryant said. “I think Curt is also a very excitable guy and he’s super committed to what we’re doing here out in L.A.

“He’s anxious to get to work and anxious to figure out who he’s going to be coaching and who he’s going to battle with, so we just felt like him being out there and continuing to advocate for what we’re doing out here with our build and just talk a little bit about the direction of the team, so he’s our good luck charm for sure.”

For those reasons, Miller will represent the Sparks when the WNBA draft lottery airs live at 1:30 p.m. PST Sunday on ESPN from Bristol, Connecticut. The winner of the lottery will secure the No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft, which is scheduled to take place April 15, 2024, eight days after the NCAA championship game.

According to the ESPN 2024 WNBA mock draft, Iowa senior point guard Caitlin Clark is projected to be the No. 1 pick and UConn junior point guard Paige Bueckers is projected to go second. Stanford senior forward Cameron Brink is projected to go third, the pick for which the Sparks currently hold the best odds. South Carolina senior center Kamilla Cardoso is projected to be the fourth pick.

“We’re excited about one through four, but certainly that No. 1 pick, you’re in full control,” Bryant said. “You have the opportunity to be really aggressive in your recruiting efforts because you know you’re in the driver’s seat with that first spot and you also don’t have to have as much contingency plans because you’re not following behind other teams and trying to have to factor in what they might do.”

However, there’s uncertainty around those top prospects because they have up to 48 hours after their season is over to decide whether they will stay in college and use an additional year of eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But teams like the Sparks are banking on having already made key acquisitions via free agency in the winter of 2024, which could be another way to entice talented young players to forgo any remaining eligibility and enter their names into the draft.

“I think it’s a recruiting process right and I think we haven’t been through this before, this exact scenario in terms of the COVID year and the unpredictability of what the draft class is actually going to be,” Bryant said. “But I think it’s a continuation of what we’ve been doing since the 2023 season ended, which is continuing to refine and share our story and the narrative of the next generation of the Sparks.

“Honestly, it’s going to be really important that we have a successful free agency cycle and that we come out of free agency where we have more clarity around that vision and that narrative and really look to recruit and position L.A.”

Bryant said the Sparks’ front office has already begun in-person scouting and coming up with contingency plans for their lottery pick as well as the No. 12 pick, which the team received from the Las Vegas Aces when they acquired All-Star forward Dearica Hamby before last season.

“Because of this COVID year, it’s going to make scouting, we got to be much more comprehensive and we’re going to have more people out this year because there’s a lot of unknowns,” Bryant said.

Bryant, who is entering her second offseason in her dual CAO/GM role, said the organization is also working on hiring a new assistant coach to replace Chris Koclanes, who left to become an assistant coach with USC women’s basketball in September.

Lottery odds are calculated based on the cumulative records of the past two regular seasons (2022 and 2023), in which the Sparks went 30-46, earning the third-best chance (17.8%) at the No. 1 pick. The Sparks finished 17-23 overall last season, ninth in the 12-team league, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive season, a franchise record over their 27-year history.

“Coming off on Year One, obviously a ton of disappointment in terms of missing the playoffs and injuries, but couldn’t be disappointed with the fight and the effort and just the progress we made in kind of rebuilding the culture and the look and feel of the Sparks on the court and the style of play,” Bryant said. “Obviously, being able to add a foundational talent to that. We’ve got some great veterans under contract and obviously we’re going to work to re-sign others, but having the opportunity to bring in a youth piece is really important to us.

“We obviously got Zia Cooke last year and we’re continuing to invest in her future in the WNBA. She’s actually out here now doing some marketing stuff for us but also some workouts in the gym. And having another youth piece to go along with the veterans and the All-Stars that we have is going to be an important part of Year Two.”

The Indiana Fever has the best odds (44.2%) and is guaranteed at least the third pick, followed by the Phoenix Mercury (27.6%), the Sparks and the Seattle Storm (10.4%).

The last time the Sparks were awarded the No. 1 pick, they used it to select All-Star forward Nneka Ogwumike, who is the franchise’s second-leading all-time scorer at 5883 points, trailing only Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie’s 6263 points.

If Ogwumike, 33, who is currently an unrestricted free agent after 13 seasons in Los Angeles, returns to the only franchise she’s ever played for, she would likely break Leslie’s record about midway through the season based on her career average of 16.6 points per game.

"'It was game on for a few hundred athletes, coaches and their fans this weekend at the Special Olympics Southern California Fall Games.

Athletes from all over Southern California — who have trained and practiced for several weeks, if not longer — gathered in Fountain Valley for the competition. They competed in golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

And, for the first time, athletes competed in a unified golf competition, which pairs individuals with and without intellectual disabilities, and aspiring cheerleaders participated in a new cheer camp. Eventually, the Games will include competitive and sideline cheer, said Kelly Pond, president and CEO of Special Olympics Southern California.

“By being able to celebrate people’s abilities and what they can do, it breaks down barriers and opens people’s hearts and minds to focus on the place where we’re alike and similar rather than the differences,” Pond said. “It’s so much bigger than the event itself.”

Athletes train in their local communities for several weeks ahead of the Fall Games, said Pond, often competing in local competitions in their city or county.

Aside from the competition, the Special Olympics hosted the Healthy Athletes Village where participants found free health screenings. That includes volunteer dentists who offered mouthguards for certain sports or referrals to dentists.

This year, the Healthy Athletes Village included a new component focused on mental health. Volunteer health practitioners checked in with athletes and chatted about anxiety and stressors and how to deal with them through meditation, breathing and other exercise.

“If you’ve participated in sports growing up, you know what that meant to you, and the Special Olympics is changing lives through the power of sports,” Pond said. “It’s helping our Special Olympics athletes and participants gain self-confidence.”

More than 900 participants were expected at the Games. For more information, including how to volunteer with Special Olympics, visit its website: sosc.org.'",sports,soccer

The NFC is extremely top-heavy in 2023, with four teams boasting +1700-or-shorter Super Bowl odds and the rest at +7300 or lower.

Below, we take a closer look at the top four NFC teams and sort through the other conference postseason contenders while analyzing their Super Bowl odds and chances of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy on Feb. 11 in Las Vegas.

Also, be sure to make time to check out our review of 2023′s best NFL betting sites.

NFC Super Bowl odds: San Francisco 49ers (+275 best odds)

Why they could win it all: Take the league’s most talented roster and pair it with genius coach Kyle Shanahan. Myriad QB injuries derailed the Niners last season, but so far this year, Brock Purdy is healthy and playing like an MVP, giving the Niners their best shot at a Lombardi Trophy since winning their last in 1994.

While they might not: San Francisco already has beaten the other top two NFC contenders, the Cowboys and Eagles, by a combined score of 84-29 this season. But, much like what happened in 2019, what if Purdy has an off night on the Big Game stage and is unable to keep up with one of the AFC’s elite QBs in Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson, Tua Tagovailoa, or Josh Allen?

NFC Super Bowl odds: Philadelphia Eagles (+750 best odds)

Why they could win it all: The motivation and drive of coming up three points short in last season’s Super Bowl is real, and Philly has the offensive talent — and arguably the league’s best offensive/defensive line combo — to back it up on the field.

While they might not: The Eagles’ defense, the secondary in particular, has taken a big step back this season, and they had given up 33 or more points in each of their last three games, including double-digit losses to the 49ers and Cowboys.

NFC Super Bowl odds: Dallas Cowboys (+850 best odds)

Why they could win it all: Dallas boasts a top-four-ranked scoring offense (No. 1 with 32.4 points per game) and scoring defense (fourth with 17.9 ppg) and has been getting elite QB play with 2023 Dak Prescott that the talented Cowboys teams of the last three decades have been missing.

While they might not: Dallas has been dominant at home, winning 15 straight games. The Cowboys, however, are just 8-8 on the road over that same span, and if they can’t overtake the Eagles (who own the tiebreaker edge) and win the NFC East title, they’ll need to win three postseason games — likely all on the road — just to make it out of the NFC bracket.

NFC Super Bowl odds: Detroit Lions (+2500 best odds)

Why they could win it all: Detroit has a Super Bowl quarterback in Jared Goff at the helm and enough surrounding talented pieces — including one of the league’s best offensive lines (when healthy) — to take the 2023-24 Lions where no previous team in franchise history has gone before.

While they might not: The offensive line, though, has dealt with injury issues, and it’s contributed to Goff giving glimpses of his previous rattled, turnover-prone self. Plus, the Detroit defense, while improved in some areas, still looks to be far short of championship-worthy, surrendering the league’s eighth-most points per game (24.2).

NFC Super Bowl odds: Best of the rest

We weren’t kidding about the NFC being top-heavy, as only one other team — the 7-6 Minnesota Vikings — apart from the top quartet currently owns a winning record.

Additionally, the NFC South is on track to be won by a sub-.500 team for the second straight season.

The Green Bay Packers currently sit atop a contingent of five 6-7 NFC teams to hold down the conference’s seventh and final playoff spot. So for one of these teams to get to the Super Bowl would likely require beating three of NFC’s elite four in consecutive playoff weeks.

In other words, highly unlikely.

On fans booing himself and Jericho: “I feel like maybe because it’s Jericho and it’s me and the internet likes to pick us as the guys to like hate or whatever. I’ll say this about Chris. I feel like he gets a target on his back just because he’s doing it at such a high level for such a long time. It’s sometimes easy to look at a guy and be like, ‘He’s the reason my favorites are not doing this or whatever.’ But in reality, it’s like this guy doesn’t need to do this anymore. He does it because he likes it or loves it, and the fact that he’s still doing it 33 years is a testament to him because the motivation to keep going and doing this is hard.”

On his turn on Jericho at AEW Grand Slam: “I didn’t even know the turn was going to happen that day and truthfully didn’t even want the turn to happen. I never wanted to turn on Chris. I was telling Tony [Khan] and everybody, I’m like, ‘Let’s just go our separate ways, let’s just never turn on each other.’ But it ended up happening and it went in a really cool way.”

Mark Cuban believes if the NBA does not make a significant leap into streaming with its upcoming broadcast rights deals, the league will shoot itself in the foot for the future.

The NBA’s deals with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery end after the 2024-25 season. Both companies are currently in an exclusive negotiating window with the league to retain their rights to air NBA games beyond that season.

“This next one will be good, I don’t think it will be as long as this last one,” Cuban said on All the Smoke with Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson this week. “But I’m worried about the next one after that.”

Cuban is aware of the breakdown of the traditional cable bundle model. He knows sports still represent a lifeline for cable companies, but doesn’t want the NBA to stay married to that model beyond its usefulness to the league.

“It makes sense for the streamers like Amazon, ESPN, Disney, to want to work with us long-term because it helps them reduce churn, but that’s not a sure thing at all,” Cuban explained to hosts Barnes and Jackson.

Cuban compared the next few years in the NBA to his early tenure as Dallas Mavericks owner. Back then, league revenues did not always increase year to year. Team valuations were shaky, and buying an NBA team was not considered a home-run investment like it is now.

“It’s not automatic that everything always gets better,” Cuban said. “Old-school television needs us right now because we pull better ratings.”

Looking forward, Cuban wants the NBA on streaming so it is prepared for the future. Even if that means taking a financial hit in the short-term.

“(Now) it’s all sports on linear television,” Cuban added. “That’s good in the short-term, but it’s not sustainable in the long-term.”

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver reportedly wants multiple broadcast partners on the next rights deals. While NBC Universal reportedly wants in, a carve-out or two for a streaming service makes sense.

Beyond normal regular season and playoff packages, the NBA can now sell its In-Season Tournament and Play-In Tournament individually. Netflix has been linked to interest in the In-Season Tournament package as well, but the live game portion of that has recently been downplayed.

The league is also exploring a two-day draft.

In a recent post, the U.S. Forest Service office in charge of Stanislaus National Forest took advantage of a funny situation to educate the public.

Last week, a video of the stuck truck was making the rounds on social media. The vehicle was a little ways off the nearest forest road and appeared to be in use to pick up a Christmas tree. But, it didn’t have the right tires for conditions, and was good and stuck. But, even with better tires, there are doubts out there about whether the vehicle has a decent all-wheel-drive system or has some other problem that’s keeping it from being able to tackle off-road challenges.

At the other end of the tow cable is a Ford pickup. This led to Ford CEO Jim Farley making it clear that this was not a planned photo-op of any kind. A Ford truck’s owner really just happened to be there to help.

Just to be clear… this is a Super Duty and NOT advertising. Glad a @Ford owner was there to help. https://t.co/Rr78EY9k2T — Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) December 13, 2023

But, when the U.S. Forest Service supervisors came across the video, they weren’t as happy. Their job is to manage federally-owned forest lands, and that includes making sure the forest stays healthy. This not only provides lumber for the future if managed responsibly and not over or under-cut, but also helps protect precious watersheds that people rely on for drinking water and farming.

One of the key problems for both forest products and watersheds is erosion. Soils have to remain stable and healthy for the forest and the rivers to thrive. So, most forests have rules about where you can drive vehicles. Generally, full-sized vehicles have to stick to forest and fire roads. Smaller ATVs, UTVs, and dirtbikes can access additional trails. Finally, non-motorized bikes can access a few more trails while people on foot can go pretty much anywhere.

But, instead of chewing Tesla out for having an employee go off established roads, managers took it for an educational opportunity. In a tongue-in-cheek manner, the agency asked Tesla to partner with the on educating the public about motor vehicle use maps (MVUMs), which specify where vehicles are allowed, as well as where vehicle-based “boondock” camping can be legally done.

“We are always thrilled when new opportunities to explore our public lands become available,” said Stanislaus National Forest Supervisor Jason Kuiken. “But feel there may be work to be done in educating users about our Motor Vehicle Use Maps (MVUM). We feel confident that had the driver of the Cybertruck had a better understanding of the topographical feature indicated on our maps, practiced Leave No Trace principles, and generally been more prepared, this whole incident could have been not only avoided, but also provided much-needed education to many new off-road users.”

The supervisor also poked fun at the problem of software updates.

“You never have to worry about a software update at an incredibly awkward moment with one of our MVUM maps,” Kuiken said. “We would invite executives of Tesla Motors to sit down at the table with us and develop an educational experience for new Cybertruck owners. We expect we could see this excited new user base joining our well-established OHV community and want to ensure we’ve done everything to create a positive user experience.”

"'Alejandro Guido of the San Diego Loyal SC hugs his wife after a 4-3 loss to Phoenix Rising FC at a USL soccer match on Sunday, Oct. 22, 2023 in San Diego. (K.C. Alfred /The San Diego Union-Tribune via AP)

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Landon Donovan’s San Diego Loyal soccer club was born on March 7, 2020, playing its first match a few days before the pandemic shut down the world.

It died late on a misty Sunday night on an absolute gut punch of a goal in the 119th minute of a playoff opener. Exhausted, heartbroken players sprawled on the pitch after the final whistle. Their passionate fans, many of whom had been chanting, singing, banging drums, waving flags and setting off green and orange smoke bombs for more than two hours at cozy 6,000-seat Torero Stadium at the University of San Diego, fell silent.

Players and fans knew since late August that the second-tier team was going to fold at season's end, in large part because of the impending arrival of the expansion MLS team San Diego FC in 2025 that will play at 35,000-seat Snapdragon Stadium. Everyone tried to make the best of it, and the independent supporter group The Locals, whose members packed section 109 behind the east goal every match, came up with the slogan, “Bury us with the cup.”

The end came with a jolt, not a cup.

Donovan, one of the greatest American soccer players of all time, co-founded the Loyal and was their coach the first three seasons before being elevated to executive vice president of soccer operations for this season.

“It's a shame that this has to go away,” a subdued Donovan said after the Loyal lost 4-3 in overtime to Phoenix in the USL Championship conference quarterfinals after tying it on a penalty kick in stoppage time. “I don't remember any of the results right now. I just remember the people involved and what we all put together was really unique. I've never seen anything like it in my life in this game and I'm not sure if it will ever exist again like this.

“We had a real identity that I think people connected with and were drawn to. I think that's what set us apart.”

The Loyal became known around the soccer world for taking powerful stances on social justice issues. Their inaugural season ended abruptly when they walked off the field — essentially costing them a playoff spot — after openly gay midfielder Collin Martin allegedly was called a homophobic slur by a Phoenix player. A week earlier, the Loyal asked to forfeit their 1-1 tie at the Los Angeles Galaxy II to protest San Diego’s Elijah Martin allegedly being called a racial slur.

Englishman Charlie Adams, who scored the first goal in Loyal history, said it was a bittersweet ending, particularly knowing he was seeing some of the fans for the last time.

“I'm absolutely devastated that the club won't be going forward but again, so happy I got to experience this and live this,” Adams said. He said he was so focused on finishing the Loyal's run that he hasn't thought yet about securing his next contract.

A few days before the end, Adams said trying to comprehend the death of a soccer club “is so strange. I think over here it happens way too often than it should. Obviously it's terribly sad. It happens in England, but only for severe, severe financial reasons, which you rarely see. Usually someone comes in and helps out. But for us it was a short and sweet time and I think we made a really, really great impact on our community, on soccer in general. I'm sure a lot of people fell in love with this club and football because of us.”

Two weeks earlier, after the last home match of the regular season, Adams dropped by a pub favored by The Locals. “They bought me a half pint, because I was driving, you see. They've been fabulous with us.”

Owner Andrew Vassiliadis announced in late August that the club was folding, citing the inability to find locations for a stadium, training facility and academy. Financial losses in the face of MLS's arrival were also a factor.

Vassiliadis was among the last to leave the stadium Sunday night.

“This hurts. I think this team was good enough to go further than we did, but I'm happy with who we are and what we accomplished,” Vassiliadis said.

Saying he wants to support soccer in his native San Diego, even it can't be with his Loyal anymore, Vassiliadis attended San Diego FC's name and crest reveal party Friday night. San Diego FC had already hired some employees away from the Loyal.

“Unfortunately, I think we're still a little too early in our soccer history in our country for both MLS and USL to thrive in one city, but I think it does come at some point. Unfortunately, it's just not right now,” he said.

He urged Loyal fans to give the MLS a chance.

“It's complicated,” said Steve Brockhoff, president of the Locals who knows his young children will want to continue to go to soccer matches. He'll miss the intimate atmosphere of Loyal matches.

“The players, you build a connection with because they don't feel too big for us as friends. They walk down these stairs and they say hi to us,"" Brockhoff said at a pre-match tailgate before the Locals marched into the stadium for the last time.

The Locals figuratively buried the Loyal late Sunday night on social media, posting a drawing of a tombstone flanked by their forlorn mascot, Bum the dog, and a soccer ball, with a brilliant sunset in the background.

Donovan, 41, isn't sure what he'll do now.

“I'm at peace right now with not knowing and we'll see what comes next,"" he said.

"'As football fans tune into the 110th Grey Cup on Nov. 19, there will most likely be fewer of them watching than in the past. While the Grey Cup and Canadian football were once considered significant national institutions, part of their allure appears to have faded over the years.

Canadian football evolved from British rugby and has been played for over 150 years. The creation of Canadian football was a direct expression of national identity that promoted pride and patriotism, and was a way to differentiate Canada from Britain and the United States.

However, the fact that two gridiron football codes emerged in North America meant that Canadian football, like Canadian culture, would always be compared to American football.

The birth of the Grey Cup

After the inaugural Grey Cup game was played in 1909, the sport quickly grew in popularity. In 1910, special train cars were added from Toronto to transport over 5,000 football fans to Hamilton. More than 12,000 fans attended the game, putting the stadium well over capacity, and fans anxious to get in toppled the gates.

As the game was ending, fans rushed the field, preventing its completion. The following year, at the Grey Cup in Toronto, fans lined up for tickets two days before they went on sale. In 1913, a team from Hamilton travelled west on the first national Canadian football tour, raising the game’s profile further. By 1929, 29 teams in seven leagues across the country were vying for the Grey Cup.

The first victory by a Western team in 1935 helped turn the Grey Cup into a national spectacle, further increasing interest in the game. In 1948, fans of the Calgary Stampeders transformed the Grey Cup football game into a celebration of national unity and identity. Hundreds of Calgarians boarded trains and airplanes and stampeded Toronto in support of their team.

In the 1950s, the popularity of Canadian football was reinforced by the new medium of television. The 1952 Grey Cup game became the most-watched show in Canada’s short television history. In 1954, 92 television stations and 75 radio stations across North America broadcast the Grey Cup game.

According to records held by Library and Archives Canada, in 1961 Canadian television ratings showed that CFL games attracted four times as many viewers as NFL games. A survey of Canadians revealed that 92 per cent preferred the CFL to the NFL, and 84 per cent believed the CFL was more exciting.

Decline of Canadian football

Today, the situation has reversed. It is now common for NFL games to have more Canadian viewers than CFL games. Recent surveys show more Canadians follow American football than Canadian football. At one time, Canadians purchased Grey Cup pool tickets and attended Grey Cup parties, but recent surveys show that today, Canadian football fans prefer to watch the Super Bowl over the Grey Cup. In Canada, media coverage of the NFL dwarfs coverage of the CFL and the focus from Canadian media is often negative. Across Canada, it is much more common to see people wearing merchandise from an NFL team than wearing CFL merchandise.

Attendance has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels. Watching a game on television, one often sees more empty seats than filled. In 2012, CFL average attendance was 29,190 but dropped to 21,744 by 2022. As national institutions, the Grey Cup and the CFL appear to be on the decline.

Large new stadiums opened in the 1970s and ‘80s, creating an illusion that the league was doing well. However, the Montreal Alouettes ceased operations in 1982, reemerged and folded again in 1987. The CFL expanded to American locations in search of life-saving revenue, but every U.S.-based team folded. Montréal commenced operations again in 1996, but the Ottawa franchise folded.

The reasons for this shift are numerous. Canada in 2023 is very different than it was in the 1960s. It is a much more multicultural country with opportunities to follow many global sports, including soccer, cricket and rugby. Today, Canadian football is competing with numerous other forms of entertainment.

The political economy of football also conspires against the CFL. The NFL features teams in larger metropolitan areas that generate more media coverage and revenues from advertising and sponsorship.

Additionally, a North American sporting culture has arisen that includes Canadian teams in U.S.-based professional baseball, soccer and basketball leagues. In a globalized world, consumers want access to “world-class” entertainment, which some believe is more likely to feature teams from Los Angeles or New York.

The coveted younger demographic group is less likely to be concerned about place and more likely to be interested in status. The NFL can provide that status. Despite a 2014 survey demonstrating that most Canadians feel that the Grey Cup is an important aspect of Canadian culture and identity, for some, the Cup’s century-long tradition seems antiquated and less appealing.'",sports,football

PHILADELPHIA — Kyle Schwarber hit two of Philadelphia’s three solo homers off Merrill Kelly, and the sweet-swinging Phillies pounded the Arizona Diamondbacks 10-0 on Tuesday night for a 2-0 lead in the NL Championship Series.

Trea Turner also connected and J.T. Realmuto had two hits and three RBIs as Philadelphia improved to 7-1 in the playoffs, moving closer to a second straight World Series appearance. Aaron Nola tossed three-hit ball and struck out seven in six innings.

Game 3 is Thursday at Chase Field. The Texas Rangers also hold a 2-0 lead over the Houston Astros in the ALCS headed into Wednesday’s game.

It was another loud night in Philly as Kelly was roasted after saying fans at Citizens Bank Park could not possibly be any louder than the ones he heard cheering for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.

Not just any Classic game. The one in May when Turner hit a grand slam for the United States that lifted them into the tournament’s semifinals.

“I haven’t obviously heard this place on the field,” Kelly said ahead of Game 1, “but I would be very surprised if it trumped that (WBC) game down in Miami.”

As the kids say, challenge accepted.

Kelly, a 12-game winner this season, was voraciously booed from pregame introductions to his walk to the mound, a sort of we’ll-show-you vibe from 45,412 Phillies diehards determined to shake the ballpark again in October.

How loud?

“AC/DC concert level,” loud, Turner said before Game 2.

Phillies manager Rob Thomson said a rival coach told him last season that a playoff game in Philly was “four hours of hell,” and Turner sent a charge through the crowd when he clocked a four-seam fastball to left-center field for a 1-0 lead in the first.'",sports,tennis

Taylor Swift's NFL era: As the end of the 2023 NFL regular season nears, it's clear the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season was Taylor Swift (Travie Kelce, too). Swift's appearances at NFL stadiums including Lambeau, Gillette and Arrowhead sent Swifties of all ages into a frenzy that nearly overwhelmed the league itself. Football purists found the intrusion and Swift-related attention unnerving, but the pop sensation brought millions of new fans to the game. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be going strong, which means fans can expect to see Taylor herself in the stands of Kansas City Chiefs games as her schedule allows. Football fans may find it slightly annoying. But if the attention (and new audience) Taylor brought to professional NFL football just by showing up wasn't proof enough, it's Taylor's world and we're all just living in it -- one era at a time.

Is this the Cowboys year? Being a Dallas Cowboys fan requires a Texas-sized emotional commitment. Last season, fans gutted through quarterback Dak Prescott's winning record (not in a good way) of most interceptions thrown in the 2022-2023 season. Dak whittled his interceptions down this season and the Cowboys managed the unthinkable -- they toppled the mighty Philadelphia Eagles from their perch atop the NFC East in Week 14. But the Cowboys' 31-10 upset loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15 is the kind of play that makes Cowboys fans weary. The Cowboys could go all the way to the Super Bowl this season, but it won't be without taking Cowboys fans on an emotional rollercoaster best left at an amusement park.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different. Lamar is poised to have the best seasons of his career. MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already making a case to turn those MVP chants into reality. If you don't mind being called a ""bandwagon"" by the teenager in your life, there's never been a better time to jump on the Ravens bandwagon. We won't tell and neither should you.'",sports,football

(CNN) — Here is a look at FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), international soccer’s governing body and organizer of global tournaments including the World Cup.

Other Facts

The Blue Ridge Parkway is back open after crews worked to clear debris from the Matts Creek wildfire, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

Fire-weakened trees and other debris on and along the parkway were removed, and traffic is now able to safely pass through.

With Tuesday’s rain, drivers are urged to proceed carefully, especially at higher elevations as the roadway may be icy at times.

Forest Service officials said there were two inches of rain that came down Tuesday, helping to reduce wildfire activity.

We’re told two inches of rain is equivalent to about 600 million gallons of water across the fire area. The 600 million gallons of water is about the same as 200,000 air tanker drops or two million Type 6 engine water tanks used on the fire, officials said.

As of Tuesday evening, the fire had stalled at 11,020 acres and was 57% contained.'",climate,forest fire
"'For several months in 2023, global sea surface temperatures reached record-high levels, fueled by decades of human-caused climate warming and a recent boost from the natural climate phenomenon El Niño.

For several months in 2023, global sea surface temperatures reached record-high levels, fueled by decades of human-caused climate warming and a recent boost from the natural climate phenomenon El Niño. Some areas—including the seas around Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas—saw particularly high temperatures, with implications for the health of coral reefs.

Corals thrive within a small range of temperatures and become stressed when water is too hot or cold. Bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel the algae that live inside them, stripping corals of their color. Extreme bleaching can leave a reef susceptible to starvation, disease, and even death. Observations made by divers in the Florida Keys found that the marine heatwave in summer 2023 caused widespread bleaching.

Stress on corals can also be detected using data from satellites. This animation shows the evolution of accumulated heat stress from July through September 2023. The colors depict “degree heating weeks” (°C-weeks)—a measure that provides an estimate of the severity and duration of thermal stress. Data for the product are compiled by NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch, which blends observations from polar orbiting satellites such as the NASA-NOAA Suomi NPP, and from geostationary satellites such as GOES, with computer models.

We don't know about you, but we're currently in our football era — and it's all thanks to Taylor Swift. Ever since the pop superstar made her surprise appearance at that fateful Sunday Night Football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Chicago Bears back in September, we've found ourselves hyper-focused on the football season more than ever before. Sure, the games themselves have been entertaining — when you've got generational talents (and TikTok-loved players) like Joe Burrow, Patrick Mahomes, and newly minted Skims model Nick Bosa all in the league, you can bet some pretty high-stakes showdowns will take place. But perhaps even better than who's playing on the field is who's showing up and showing out in the stands — especially when the talent is Ms. Swift herself.

From creating touchdown-celebration handshakes with Brittany Mahomes to chatting up Donna Kelce with a vodka cranberry cocktail in hand, Swift appears to be leaning all the way into her WAG era — and inspiring a whole new legion of fans to become just as obsessed with football as she is (or at least just tune in to see what the musician's wearing). Whether you're a dedicated NFL viewer looking to embrace the Swift x NFL crossover or simply a loyal Swiftie hoping to love the sport just as much as the singer, you can conquer football season in style with these game-day outfits — all of which are inspired by Swift's outfits, no less.

From logo sweaters with ""NFL (Taylor's Version)"" printed across the front to cool windbreaker jackets and other stylish football outfits that play into this iconic crossover between sports and pop culture, here's what to wear to watch football games with a Swiftie-inspired twist. These pieces are perfect for even the most casual viewers, and you can wear them at home or to a game — hey, maybe you'll even get a glimpse of Swift herself.'",sports,football

Watch NCAA football live with a digital HDTV antenna

Amazon

IIf you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.

Anyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).

This amplified indoor HDTV antenna claims to have a 250-mile range and comes with a 16.5-foot coaxial cable. It's rated 4.0 stars by Amazon reviewers. Regularly $33, it's currently on sale for $23 after Black Friday and ahead of Cyber Monday, but you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to score the deal.

More teams to follow during the 2023 college football season

Important dates for the 2023 college football season:

The 13-week 2023 college football season runs from Aug. 27 through Dec. 9.

Two semifinal games, the Rose Bowl Game and the Allstate Sugar Bowl, are scheduled for New Year's Day (Monday, January 1, 2024).

The College Football Playoff National Championship is scheduled for Monday, January 8, 2024 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas.

The Georgia Bulldogs want to make history: The Bulldogs struck gold last season winning back-to-back championships after beating the Alabama Crimson Tide 33-18 in 2022. Since 1936, no college team has won three-in-a-row. Coming into Week 13, the Bulldogs are one of six teams that remain undefeated and have reclaimed the top spot in just about every college football ranking. Head coach Kirby Smart started the season aiming for the elusive three-peat, which is looking less elusive with each game of the season.

Football fans can't get enough of the Colorado Buffaloes: If it seems like the biggest story of the 2023 NCAA college football season isn't on the field, you're not wrong. Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders, aka Coach Prime, has dominated sports headlines since he announced in December of 2022 he'd leave the 11-1 Jackson State football program he'd built over the past three years in favor of the 1-11 Colorado Buffaloes. Coach Prime in prime time has proven a success despite the team's 4-7 record. Winning or losing, the Buffaloes have seen skyrocketing TV ratings, the one bright spot in an ugly year for Pac-12 football.

How will all the college football shake ups shake out? In July 2022, UCLA and USC finally agreed on something. The frenemy rivals would both leave the Pac-12 in favor of the Big Ten in 2024. This summer, Colorado announced it would return to the Big 12. Since then, Arizona, Arizona State and Utah have announced an exodus from the Pac-12 to the Big-12 at the end of the 2023 season. Washington and Oregon State are also ditching the Pac-12 for the Big 10 at the same time.

The school shuffling won't affect the 2023 season much, but expect journalists to talk about it to no end. With the Pac-12 currently down to just four teams for the 2024 season, the demise of the Pac-12 is sure to be one of the biggest stories of the season.

The Alabama Crimson Tide came into the 2023 season ranked No. 4. Saban and company weren't comfortable with the demotion. The Tide are hoping to be a major threat to the Bulldogs scoring that three-peat. Ohio State has arguably one of the best receiver rooms in college football led by the dazzling Marvin Harrison Jr. The Buckeyes come into Week 13 undefeated, just one win over the 10-1 Crimson Tide.

The Steelers second-year quarterback Kenny Pickett is also a Pitt alum. But for the 25-year-old, it's still a big deal to face Donald in a game. Pickett explained that No. 99 was a huge influence on him while at Pitt, even if the LA Rams star had no idea.

""He kind of showed me the way, and showed me how to train and how to work,"" said Pickett. ""From afar, I would just watch. I never really talked — just hellos — until I earned his respect to be able to talk to him a little bit more. But there's a reason he is who he is, and he works hard. Showed me the ropes.""

Storylines We're Following This NFL Season

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

Let's talk about those Lions: The Detroit Lions come into Week 7 with a 5-1 record, putting them three games ahead of the Green Bay Packers for the top spot in the AFC North. The division dominated by Aaron Rodgers for so long now belongs to Jared Goff and the Lions. Fueled by Dan Campbell and a defense you'd hate to be on the other side of, the Lions rebuild is in full effect. Do the Lions have what it takes to go all the way to the Super Bowl? That remains to be seen, but we're going to have fun watching them try. If there ever was an NFL underdog we're rooting for, it would be this team.

Taylor Swift is the only thing bigger than the NFL: Taylor and Travis officially made it official this past weekend, hard launching their romance with surprise cameos on SNL and a public moment of PDA that sent Swifties and the Chiefs Kingdom swooning. As if fans weren't already on the Chiefs bandwagon, Swift has made fans of entire universe of 12-year-old girls. If they weren't already tuning in, they are now. With booming ratings, windbreaker sales galore and Taylor spotting at Arrowhead Stadium, Taylor Swift has proved that the only thing bigger than the NFL is her.

That 49ers defense is dangerous: Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. The Niners come into Week 7 with just loss. If this team can stay healthy, they have the makings of a Super Bowl contender and one of the most fun teams to watch this season.

Yes, this is an opportunity, you know, I piggyback off of what Chris said because in the last 50 55 years, there have been, you know, black coaches that had elevated whether in uh college or the NBA. And I'm talking about Mary and E Washington who was the first division one, black female college 50 51 years ago and title nine made that happen. I just want to get your thoughts, not on, not only on her accomplishment but uh the opportunities that Title nine has offered, you know, women, black women and women overall. You just wanna get equal opportunity, you just wanna be seen, you want to be seen as, as equal and, and, and like really given the the opportunity to grow, like you just can't jump in this position to be *** coach. Someone has to give you an opportunity way back to learn and to grow. And I think there are people out there that just see you and see your talent. They don't care that you are *** woman and they want to give you these opportunities. Title nine has been amazing by I think opening people's eyes of saying, hey, we're here, they can do it too. So being sitting here and part of this uh obviously part of Title nine playing in women's college basketball and being able to have that opportunity. Um I, I've been the beneficiary of it. It's been great. Hi Lindsay. Hi. How much will your basketball philosophy align with Mike Brown and the big team and everything we would like to think we are an extension of the Sacramento Kings. Um I would like *** seamless transition for players that are going to be going back and forth with that. Um You know, he, he talks *** lot about, about playing together as *** team playing, physical, playing fast and that's exactly what we're gonna do as well. Um I might have my own little style and flair to it, but it's gonna be pretty similar with that. He's been very, very clear. Hey Lindsay, uh, too quick for you real quick. Um, the first one just coaching in general, um, following your player playing days. When, how quickly did that become on your radar? That, that, that was something you wanted to do? Oh, really? Not at all. I actually, I actually, I was told by my college coach years ago, I'd be *** great coach and I thought she was crazy. I was like, no, I'm not gonna do that when I thought NBA, I thought of more maybe front office. Um, and I started off as *** scout. I worked in the league office and then I was *** scout and I had an opportunity to be *** player development coach when I was with Philadelphia and I loved it. I absolutely loved it and I, I didn't expect to get here where I am years later, but I just kind of followed that path and I enjoyed it. Yeah. And speaking of that, just Philadelphia being on Luke Walton's staff, being with Mike Brown staff. What were you able to take from maybe each individual spot that you can apply going forward in your coaching career? Each individual? That's *** great question. Uh First, first starting I had Brett Brown and I was like, knew nothing about the NBA. He was very open. He had his office open anytime I think him giving me the opportunity to ask and share and um, he didn't put me in *** box if that makes sense, you know, sometimes you're nervous and you don't want to say anything. He would call me over, ask what I think. And it was really cool to tell him something and to see him actually do it. I don't know if he did it on purpose or if he fully believed in it, but it gave me confidence. So I, I love that coming here with, um, when Luke Walton brought me here, it was my first time doing scouts really like learning the process of having to do that, understanding that different coaches, different teams, different people, they do it in several ways and, um, each year it was done differently, but that helped me grow as far as like even having *** voice in front of the team. And then now here with, with coach Brown, um, man, how much time you got? Um, it's, it's been *** lot. Um, he's sitting here in the back of the room but like it's, it's for one that shows you the support that our head coach is standing right here for this press conference in the back of the room. But, um, I think he's on my speed dial. I can text him whether it is about basketball or about other personal things. Um Any questions I have, he's there to give an answer if he, um, and he's the kind of leader that he doesn't care if you are *** video person or have this much experience or none at all. If you have something to say and he likes it, he will use it. And I think that gives so many people confidence. If he doesn't like something, he'll tell you that too, but that also makes you better. Um But I have to say, and I will say this directly to you, Coach Brown, you have given me so much confidence last season to be in this position now because I know no matter what you guys have my back. Hey Lindsay, um back here, do you consider yourself *** Trailblazer? I've been called that before. Um I, I, when you think about it, II, I think I am, I think I am when I'm just coaching, you don't think about any of that. You go, you do your job. Uh but when you take the time and you really sit and, and think about it, I mean, how many women look like me that do this? I didn't have this when I was *** kid. I didn't have someone that looked like me that was doing this, that I could say, hey, I wanna do it. I think *** lot of these young men, I mean, they're so lucky they, they, they're able to see somebody and see the path to get there. I don't really know the path to get to the highest level. I'm just kind of making it as I go. So I guess Trailblazer might be the the word for it. Hi, Lindsay. Congratulations on your accomplishment back here. I wanted to ask, have you spoken to any other women around the league? Whether that be Becky Hammond and, and her experience? And what advice did she give you? And, and if you haven't spoken to maybe someone in her role, uh, whether that's your family or your mom or so. So, *** woman that you look up to, that gave you an advice that you stick with. I, I, I've known Becky since the, my years playing in the W NBA. So like I talked to her when I first got in the NBA and she talked *** lot about her experiences giving me little Nuggets, uh uh about, um, you know, just, just kind of her experience and things that can help get me ahead. Um I remember her telling me my first summer league, this was years ago. She's like, stick with it. We need more women here. Um For one, I just want to congratulate her on her second championship back to back. That is big time. And that also says what kind of coach she is. But no, we've definitely have spoken in the past about it. And um yeah, I, I just, I just know that I want to be also open for other women that's coming up that may have any questions uh moving forward because she definitely helped me, Lindsay, you, you mentioned how much you love coaching. Now, what, what do you love about coaching? I think the uh the, the, the teaching part of it, I mean, it's, it's all teaching, right? Um we all learn differently, we all um you know, kind of absorb things differently. But, you know, I come from like from the court and being able to, my approach is as ***, as *** former player at times, I remember being in certain situations, I remember feeling certain things from being the starter to the the star number one pick to being injured and never playing. So I feel that I have that understanding, but when you've worked so hard with *** player throughout my year in something and maybe their contract is coming to an end and they're stressed and then you see them get an extension or you see them get an opportunity elsewhere or uh you see *** player like bet on themselves and then two years later they get *** big deal. It is such *** great feeling to know that you're one of the coaches that they pick up the phone and call that they call and they say, oh, I got this. I'm so excited. Thank you. So I think that's probably like the best, the best part of it. Hey, Lindsay, congratulations. Um You mentioned that you kind of had the idea of eventually being *** G league head coach for *** little while. When did that first come on your radar? And what did you need to do to progress from that point to where you're at now. I, at first I thought it was like *** pretty cool opportunity. You know, the G LEAGUE has about half the players in the NBA have played there. *** lot of the coaches coach there, referees have to go through there. I, I felt that that would be part of the path of my continual to grow. Uh, as *** coach, I can't remember the exact time uh when it was, but I feel like maybe *** few years ago, it was kind of like, huh, that could be *** great opportunity. Um But I, I kind of sat there to see what opportunities open for me. It wasn't like this is the exact thing that I want to do if it opened, if the opportunity presented itself to me and I was in the right position, had the right support, had the confidence I felt I would want to take it. But I also understand that there's not many people that look like me doing this like there's no one. So I have to have *** level of confidence and support to do this. Hey, hi, what is your style and flair? What is that? You don't see the bling, the bling, you don't see the bling. I got it on my shoes too. Um, style and flair. Huh? Well, not that there are so many look, OK, put it this way with the G League. I feel *** little bit more. Would there be some opportunities where there's defensively or offensively trying to do something *** little different? But as *** whole, we're going to be the extension of the kings. But, um, you know, I wish I could wear this, but we're still going to be wearing the same outfits as everybody else. Hello. Congratulations Lindsay. Uh You know, we talked *** lot about you becoming this Trailblazer and shattering that glass ceiling. And you know, paving the way, I'm curious if you can go back and tell 16 year old or 17 year old Lindsay Harden something about this journey that you've embarked on. What would you tell that young girl? Another good question. What would I tell myself? I'd say just like set really high goals, I think even goals where people think that you might be crazy even though something that might have never been done before you set something so, so high and you're reaching and reaching for it. So many more opportunities open up and some of those opportunities might be the one that you're supposed to be going towards. And I think if you set things low, like, oh, this is easy, I can do it. Um You don't really get to reach your full potential and I would also say being uncomfortable is where you want to be the moment you're comfortable and you're there, you're not really expanding and growing. You should at some level, feel *** little bit uncomfortable in *** sense of what you're doing. And I kind of felt that as *** player and those are the moments that I felt that I showed greatness as *** player when I was uncomfortable and able to push through that and win certain games or pushed through the uncomfortable. Like I, I felt like I was going to collapse because I was tired. So I, I think those are things of, of setting high goals and pushing through uh moments where you are uncomfortable. Um In doing so, Lindsay not to put the cart too far in front of the horse, but you talk about this being the next step. And, and so what, what is the step after this? What is the ultimate goal? Is it W NBA head coach? Is it *** college men's head coach? Is it head coach in the NBA? What, what is the ultimate goal for you even though I know you said you don't wanna just pigeonhole yourself to just one thing. What are you wanting winning *** championship? That's really where my mind is right now. No. Uh I, I mean, I, I'm so excited about this opportunity. Like I'm so excited about this opportunity right here. What I love to keep going and be ***, *** head coach at another level maybe. But right now, this is my focus. This is my goal. This is where my mind is and this is what I'm going to put all my effort and energy on after this year, how everything goes, ask that question to me again and we'll see where it goes from there. But right now, I want to see where this goes, how far we can go, how many players I can help to help this team so we can all, you know, win *** championship. Lindsay. I know that you are about the work and you're driven, you're determined and you partnering with an angel to, to be the first led team by women, both on the coaching side and the front office side. How has the process been starting it in terms of working together, setting goals and, and the transition into the new role? I have to tell you, Angeli has been amazing. She has been on it. I mean, I feel like since I got this job, um she's been on my phone every single day, all day um because she's really excited for this opportunity and we also aren't taking it for granted. We understand the weight of this. We both do. We can't just be good. We have to be great. We both understand that. So her starting early and, and, and it was really big because the first thing she talked to me about was being transparent. She wanted to have open dialogue about players, about situations, wanting to know what I thought, even wanting to know what, what my staff thinks about certain players style that I or we want to play and it has just been really great to, to do this with her because she has, I have to tell you she has worked so hard. I think it was, did you text me at four in the morning? It was this morning. But um it's just, it's just really been great. This is my first time experiences. I, I really didn't know what to expect. Um But really having that like open dialogue with her throughout this process has, yeah, this organization have moves uh all women female broadcast team just *** couple of years ago, you know, during COVID and now you know what you two coming in here, which is extraordinary. What, what is your thought about the Sacramento Kings Stockton Kings organization over? Uh let's not the first female to coach here either. I think I'm the third to, to be here. Always done it. I see *** coach as *** coach, whether you are *** man or *** woman and they've always given opportunity. They're not just handing out something you gotta come and you gotta do your work. But if you do your work and you're good, you will get opportunity. I think it has gone through our front office. That's how they do it and being *** part of that and, and, and seeing that, I, I mean, why wouldn't this be the organization to do this if you really look at the past and the history of what they've done. Like, why not? This was, uh I, I don't think even like blink of an eye for them. So I, I feel really lucky to be *** part of it and that for them, the biggest part is just the, the growth and opportunity that they're giving people within the organization to get opportunities I think is really huge one. Thank you.

"'Taylor Swift resumed The Eras Tour Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after postponing a concert amid a dangerous heatwave and the death of a fan.

During Sunday's show, Swift performed ""Bigger Than the Whole Sky"" as one of her surprise songs, what fans speculated could be a tribute to Ana Clara Benevides Machado who died Friday before Eras kicked off.

The ""Cruel Summer"" singer postponed her concert the night before due to ""extreme temperatures."" On Friday morning, the apparent temperature — a combination of temperature and humidity — was recorded at 138 F, the highest index ever recorded in the area.

""I'm writing this from my dressing room at the stadium. The decision has been made to postpone tonight's show due to extreme temperatures in Rio. The safety and well-being of my fans, fellow performers and crew has to and will always come first,"" Swift wrote.

TAYLOR SWIFT ‘DEVASTATED' AS FAN DIES BEFORE BRAZIL CONCERT

Swift, 33, is scheduled to perform in São Paulo on Nov. 24-26, and rain is likely in the forecast for the remaining three shows of the year. She'll pick up the tour with dates in Japan in 2024.

Prior to canceling Saturday's concert, Taylor admitted her heart was ""shattered"" upon hearing about the death of a fan who fainted at the stadium and later died at a local hospital.

TAYLOR SWIFT POSTPONES BRAZIL CONCERT DUE TO ‘EXTREME TEMPERATURES’ A DAY AFTER FAN DIES AT SHOW

""I can’t believe I’m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show,"" she wrote on Instagram before opening night.

""I can’t even tell you how devastated I am by this. There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.""

Ana Clara Benevides Machado was later identified as the fan who died on Swift's opening night of The Eras Tour. The 23-year-old fainted at the Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium and later died. Her cause of death is currently unknown.

Swift continued, ""I’m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it.

""I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.""

Following Machado's death, Rio's mayor, Eduardo Paes, Rio's mayor, ordered actions against The Era's Tour production.

""The loss of a young woman's life yesterday at the show in Engenhão is unacceptable. Obviously, we are still finding out more details about the circumstances of what happened,"" the mayor began on X, formerly known as Twitter.

"'By Bruno Kelly

MANAUS (Reuters) - Indigenous inhabitants in the Amazon are asking the Brazilian government to declare a climate emergency as their villages have no drinking water, food or medicine due to a severe drought that is drying up rivers vital for travel in the rainforest, their leaders said on Tuesday.

The drought and heatwave has killed masses of fish in the rivers that Indigenous people live off and the water in the muddy streams and tributaries of the Amazon river has become undrinkable, the umbrella organization APIAM that represents 63 tribes in the Amazon said.

""We ask the government to declare a climate emergency to urgently address the vulnerability Indigenous peoples are exposed to,"" APIAM urged in a statement released at a news conference.

The Rio Negro, Solimoes, Madeira, Jurua and Purus rivers are drying up at a record pace, and forest fires are destroying the rainforest in new areas in the lower Amazon reaches, APIAM said in a statement.

Environment Minister Marina Silva told Reuters last month the government was preparing a task force to provide emergency assistance to the Amazon region hit by the drought. It has sent tens of thousands of food parcels to communities isolated by the lack of river transport.

The region is under pressure from the El Nino weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average.

The most serious problem for Indigenous communities that have no running water is sanitation now that the river water cannot be drunk, APIAM coordinator Mariazinha Bare said.

""The smaller rivers have dried up and turned to mud,"" Bare said in an interview. ""Indigenous people have to walk long distances in the rainforest to find potable water, and the poor quality of water is making people ill,"" she said.

Impassable rivers have made it harder for medical assistance to reach Amazon villages, Bare said, and rain is not expected until the end of November or early December when the rivers and their fish population normally renew themselves.

The Madeira river to the southwest is no longer navigable in its upper reaches, isolating Indigenous villages and non-Indigenous communities that rely on collecting fruit in the rainforest but cannot move their produce out.

Ivaneide Bandeira, who heads the Kaninde Indigenous organization in the state of Rondonia, said isolated non-Indigenous communities were asking Indigenous villages for food.

She said the smoke from forest fires was worse than ever, aggravating the climate crisis and affecting the health of the elderly and children.

""It is not just the El Nino current. Deforestation continues with these fires,"" she said by telephone. ""The agricultural advance does not stop. They are destroying everything, as if they do not see what is happening to nature,"" she said.

"'The family-run Arden Hills private club and resort — which for generations has fostered Olympic swim athletes and professional tennis players among its Sacramento suburban member families — is being acquired by a national chain of athletic clubs and gyms after 69 years of local control.

“Sadly, after nearly 70 years, Arden Hills will cease its operations as of December 31, 2023,” the club’s acting executive director, Austin Favero, said in a letter to members. The Favero family has owned the club since 1985.

Terms of the sale for the Fair Oaks Boulevard icon, including the price paid, were not disclosed.

The buyer, Life Time — which operates 170 clubs in the U.S. and Canada, including facilities in Roseville and Folsom — will rebrand the 8.78-acre resort on the border of Arden Arcade and Carmichael as Life Time Arden when the company takes over next year, said Favero, whose family purchased the resort from legendary swimming coach Sherm Chavoor.

Arden Hills, which opened in 1954 as a modest neighborhood athletic club that has expanded over the years to include multiple pools, a day spa, lodging and manicured grounds, calls itself “the only resort-style private club,” in the capital region. Arden Hills was the go-to spot for events such as bridal showers and has hosted thousands of weddings, according to the club’s website. The operators stopped hosting weddings and other social functions earlier this year, according to Sacramento Business Journal.

In 1992, Arden Hills broke away from other private clubs in the region, such as Del Norte and Park Terrace, to embark on an ambitious plan to double its size and offer more amenities such as a 20,000-square-foot indoor pool, spa and dining facilities. It also sold some of its land to build luxury homes.

COVID dealt financial blow to Arden Hills

Despite the successes in transforming Arden Hills from a community private club to a year-round resort, Arden Hills suffered greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic, the owner said in the letter to members.

“As we approached 2020, the club was thriving, and our family was in the process of passing the torch to the next generation, eager to continue the club’s success for decades to come,” the family said. “Yet, as fate would have it, a curveball was thrown our way.”

The operators said that “every facet of Arden Hills, from the gym to the spa, weddings and events, restaurants, and lodging, found itself directly in the cross hairs of the worldwide shutdown.”

While the owners had received $1.2 million in federal funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, “it fell far short of making up for the losses,” they said.

“The club had never closed for more than a day for nearly seven decades. Yet, it took over 18 months to fully reopen the gym, the restaurant, and the spa, and three years to navigate the complexities surrounding weddings and events.”

The Favero family said it explored multiple options to weather the crisis including changing its “overall business model, rezoning the property to maximize refinancing potential, and pursuing new investment” but ultimately decided on selling the operations.

“As we diligently worked to recover, it gradually became clear that our previously very successful business model may no longer be viable in a post-COVID world. It also became evident over time that the likelihood of identifying potential investors/buyers for the Arden Hills business had diminished significantly due to the pandemic’s devastating impact on our resources.”

New owner’s plans unclear

The owners decided on Life Time, to “preserve the legacy of this property” and “infuse it with new energy, excitement, and passion.”

Life Time, based in Chanhassen, Minnesota, said in a statement it plans a “phased renovation and transformation of the space with the goal of minimal impact on members.” The new owners said they expected to updated the property, bringing in “best-in-class equipment” as well as “a future renovation of the spa and the dining areas.”

“We are excited to build upon the Arden Hills legacy to create an incredible, high-end athletic country club experience dedicated to empowering healthier, happier lives for members,” Brian Gaeta, a vice president with the chain, said in the statement. “As with all our 170+ destinations across North America, we will provide a breadth of incomparable programming, service and the best experiences as we serve this vibrant community.”

However, details of the plan — including the cost to be a member — remain unknown. Current memberships span the $300-a-month range with upfront initiation costing at least $1,000.

“In the coming weeks, further details on Life Time’s plans, renderings and opportunities to join will be announced. Life Time operates two additional locations in the greater Sacramento market, including Folsom and Roseville, as part of its network of athletic country clubs across North America,” the company said.

The third one she gave to her coach, Sherm Chavoor, who ran Arden Hills swim club for decades before selling it to the Favero family. With Debbie in this Sacramento Bee file photo is her mother, Betty, and brothers Jeff, 12, and Carl, 8.

An Olympic legacy at Arden Hills

Arden Hills served for decades as a training ground for elite athletes. Swimmers who have trained there have won 22 Olympic gold medals, according to Arden Hills’ website.

The most famous of them: Mark Spitz, Debbie Meyer and Sue Pedersen. Spitz, a Modesto native, was the star of the 1972 Olympics in Munich by winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. Only American swimmer Michael Phelps has won more golds. Meyer and Pedersen were trained by Sherm Chavoor at the Arden Hills in the 1960s before earning medals at the Mexico City Olympics. Between the two women, they have five gold medals and two silver medals from the 1968 Games and had set several world records.

More recently, tennis pros such as Jenson Brooksby, who battled current No. 1 men’s tennis player Carlos Alcaraz at the U.S. Open in 2022, have also played at the club.

"'BAKU, Azerbaijan, October 19. The World Bank is ready to work with Azerbaijan’s newly-created Water Reserves Agency, Winston Yu, Water Practice Manager for the Europe and Central Asia Region at the World Bank, said in an exclusive interview with Trend.

“I'm delighted to see the attention being given by the government to this very important topic of water. I think it represents a huge opportunity for the government to think about how they want to better regulate the resource and how to provide better services to its people, not only households, common citizens in Baku and other cities, but also farmers who receive irrigation services,” he said.

The Azerbaijan Water Reserves Agency was established in March 2023 by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev’s order on improvement of water resources management.

The Agency has been set up on the basis of the Emergency Ministry’s State Water Reserves Agency in order to use water resources effectively and improve irrigation practices. The assets of national water and sanitation operator Azersu and Azerbaijan Melioration and Water Management joint-stock companies has been handed over to the newly-established Azerbaijan Water Reserves Agency.

Yu thinks it remains to be seen how this new agency will evolve, grow and take on new responsibilities and new roles.

“I think it represents a huge opportunity. Households, businesses and farmers need good services. And I think this is a good opportunity now to look at the roles and financial sustainability of both water and sanitation and irrigation services. The World Bank is a global institution, we have almost 300 professionals working in the water sector. So that means that we know many stories and experiences pretty similar to Azerbaijan’s. The challenges here are not very different than the challenges in Vietnam or countries in Africa and South Asia, and even in the US. I personally come from California, where we face droughts. I think one of the main tasks for the World Bank is to help share that global knowledge. This new institution, as it moves forward, can be staffed properly, they can have the right policies in place, have the right incentives in place. I am really hoping that we can be a good partner for the government and share those ideas and those experiences,” said the WB water practice manager.

He pointed out that the World Bank is happy to develop guidelines for the new agency if the Azerbaijani government asks.

“We have an ongoing technical assistance activity, within which we are undertaking a large number of analytical studies to dig a bit deeper to help the government figure out what are the priorities. As an example, we want to help the government think through the financial sustainability of this new agency, and that requires some homework on budgeting, subsidies, tariffs. Reviewing all of that, we hope we will begin to lay out a plan for the agency moving forward. But it will be the government to decide whether they want us to support them on that and be partners in this journey of this new agency,” added Winston Yu.

He went on to add that the work on creating a new water management model in Azerbaijan comprises along two streams.

“The first is looking at the water supply and wastewater sector and the other is the irrigation for farmers’ sector. In the water supply work, what we're looking at is undertaking several studies, one of which is to look at subsidies and tariffs and the whole financial arrangements. Another sub-study is to look at services, particularly, in smaller cities and rural areas where there is less concentration of people. That presents its own unique set of challenges. On the irrigation side, what we are trying to do is to develop tools that the government can use to benchmark irrigation performance. How do you know how well an irrigation system is performing? Using satellite technologies and all kinds of new modeling tools we can develop rather simple tools that the government can utilize to figure out where do we need improvements in performance, where do we need more investment and etc. These are some of the activities that we are undertaking under the current technical assistance,” said the water practice manager.

Yu noted that every country, every city needs to diversify sources, but one also needs to be mindful that there are enormous opportunities for improving efficiency.

“Anytime you have losses in your networks, it translates to losses of revenue, energy, public effort. In my view, the priority is to first improve the existing system. Many countries now are reusing wastewater, and feeding it back into the system. I think those are all very good ideas. The technologies have advanced to the point where I believe in the future the re-use of wastewater will be a norm,” he said.

As for the institutional reforms in the water sector, Yu said first of all, he hopes that the government requests the World Bank’s help and sees that it has some value to bring to the conversation.

“If the government requests help, the first thing I would share with them is the experiences in other countries. I would also share with them that this is a long-term effort and this requires enormous investment, not only in infrastructure, but also investment in people and investment in institutions. We have to think long term here. Presumably you want to leave a water supply system for your children and for their children, so that they can always have clean drinking water. Same with farmers. And that process takes quite a bit of time. There needs to be political commitment, and really genuine investment in people who will be running these systems. I think that's probably the most important thing. We have a very famous principle at the World Bank which reads that we don't want to just fix the pipes, we want to fix the institutions that fix the pipes. You can fix pipes easily, but you need to invest in people and the public to help ensure that these pipes are always fixed and people are getting good services,” noted the WB water practice manager.

Yu thinks that in an environment where climate is changing, the public finance space is much more limited, and provision of services is becoming more and more expensive, financial sustainability is a key.

“I come originally from more of the engineering and technical background. I used to think that the solution was technical, desalinization, AI, blockchain and all these things, but I'm actually more and more convinced that it is about human capacity. It is really important that we get the financing correct, so that the systems are sustainable, whatever it gets built today, will last not only your lifetime, but also your children's lifetime and their children's lifetime. We need to get the incentives right. And I think leaning towards more performance-based budgeting, and performance-based incentives is really the way to go. Unless you have proper incentives in the system, it's not going to get priorities right. Secondly, we have to make sure we separate services from regulation, the two cannot be the same. Whoever is responsible for regulating should not be the same people who are also providing a service. You know, it's hard to go further in recommendations because I think it is still early days for this institution. You need to have a proper permitting system in place. You also need to have good data, every country needs to strengthen data monitoring, and that's probably going to be a responsibility of this new agency,” Yu said.

He believes it's encouraging that the government has made a conscious political decision about forming this new agency.

“For me, that's the first step. Now, this is where the hard work begins and it requires a lot of conversation. From the World Bank side, we want to give the government as much knowledge as possible, both the good experiences and maybe even more importantly, the bad experiences, because there's been a lot of bad experiences and we don't want Azerbaijan to go down a failed path. Technology will only save us to an extent. You still have to invest in people. There's a lot of innovative things, but there's also some basic things that still need to be done. One of the things we're doing under the technical assistance is to help share with the government different kinds of models used in more rural parts of the country, which are often very different than Baku. You can still use performance-based approaches in more rural parts of the country. It's a bit more challenging, but it's not impossible,” added Winston Yu.

The World Bank water practice manager noted that there's still room for more investment in the water sector.

“From the World Bank perspective, we're ready to help the government when requested. I want to thank the new agency, and also the technical people from Azersu and Amelioration Company who've been very kind and open armed with us in discussing the issues. This technical assistance is extremely important. We thank our donor, European Union, for providing it, because it really helps to discuss with the government some big issues, and what are the emerging ideas on how to make things better. Clearly, beyond just the losses and the need to fix this problem, there's a clear institutional gap that needs to be filled. I'm hoping that this new agency will fill that gap. Time will tell and we were ready to provide the government and this new agency with our thoughts and to share the experiences worldwide,” Winston Yu concluded.

About the Writer

There’s fun to be had here — even more if you’re willing to explore.

I started this job — service journalism reporter at The Sacramento Bee — two and half years ago from my New York City apartment as a pandemic kept us home. Virtually, I began to pick up the feel of Sacramento before my big move. But it was a slow process making this city feel like home and a large part of that was me.

With your help, I embarked on a new project to gain a stronger sense of belonging to this rich city.

My only ask: Keep it affordable. In return, I’d show you where I’d been.

This month marks one year since I started “Sacramento on a Budget” — where I try an activity once a month per a reader’s suggestion with $25 — and I’ve had an absolute blast discovering this city through the eyes of the people who know it best and newbies just like me.

I’ve gotten nearly 100 suggestions, from eateries off the beaten path to activities suited for the entire family.

I ate hot water cornbread from a soul food shack in Del Paso Heights and waited 45 minutes in the summer heat for shaven ice from a Sacramento dessert shop with ties to old Japantown (well worth it).

I ice skated and went wine tasting for the first time, sipped cocktails near a bonfire with a stray cat, got a sugar rush from delicious caramel popcorn, tried an unbeatable sandwich, watched a movie the old-fashioned way, saw a peacock up close and ate authentic Lao food off the trunk of my car.

If you missed any of it — or you want to walk down memory lane with me — here’s a list of 11 cheap eats and activities I discovered around Sacramento with your help, from December 2022 to November 2023.

Thank you for an incredible year.

Drinks at Drake’s: The Barn

The Bee’s service journalism reporter Brianna Taylor poses with a $10 margarita at Drakes: The Barn in West Sacramento. She’s sharing her Sacramento discoveries through on $25 activity at a time. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 985 Riverfront St, West Sacramento

Is it affordable? Food and drinks can get pricey but parking and admission are free.

I did what most people do before going somewhere new and scrolled through Drake’s: The Barn Google reviews.

Expectations were high. That, mixed with the idea of not being able to find parking or being turned away without a reservation started to make me queasy as I drove into West Sacramento, thinking back to what an old colleague told me about Drake’s.

It’s totally your vibe and you don’t even know it.

Skating at Downtown Sacramento Ice Rink

Service Journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visits Downtown Sacramento Ice Rink at 701 K St., Sacramento on Dec. 18, 2022. She’s sharing her Sacramento discoveries through one $25 activity at a time. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 701 K St., Sacramento

Is it affordable? It depends on how many people are in your group.

Pro tip: Ice skating is nothing like rolling skating.

In my life, I have never put on a pair of ice skates — which is laughable because one of the most popular ice rinks in the world, Rockefeller Center in New York City, sits less than five miles away from my old apartment.

Downtown Sacramento Ice Rink was a good place to start.

Soul food at Tori’s Place

Location: 1525 Grand Ave, Sacramento

Is it affordable? Stick to the low-cost items. The portions are large.

A blue shack with weathered seats and brown beaded curtains serves some of the best gumbo in Sacramento — it doesn’t look like much, but it’s rooted, intentional and the food is delicious.

The cliche “don’t judge a book by its cover” certainly applies to Tori’s Place.

When I started this affordability challenge, I was hoping for experiences like this one. A place you’d probably never stumble across on a Yelp list or a quick “places near me” Google search.

Movies at West Wind Drive-in

Service Journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visits West Wind drive-in movie theater at 9616 Oates Drive, Sacramento on Friday, March 3, 2023. The six-screen theater complex was suggested by Bee reader Annette Orella. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 9616 Oates Drive

Is it affordable? Admission is affordable but concessions can add up.

I could feel the history of Sacramento’s only drive-in theater from the moment I drove up to the weathered ticket booths sandwiched between Highway 50 and Folsom Boulevard.

Built in the 1970s, West Wind is not only the last drive-in movie theater in the area — but one of the few left in California.

The first drive-in theater opened in the United States in 1933, but the concept didn’t reach its heyday until mid century. I know I’m too young to truly understand the influence drive-in theaters had on American cinema, but is it possible to feel nostalgia for something you’ve never experienced?

Turns out, it is.

Animal watching at Folsom Zoo Sanctuary

Location: 403 Stafford St., Folsom

Is it affordable? A group of three would spend less than $25 on tickets alone.

The Folsom City Zoo Sanctuary flips the original idea on its head.

Zoos were created to house animals for public display — the emphasis typically on spectacle, rather than preservation. Folsom’s animal sanctuary intrigued me because of its mission not to breed, sell or trade animals, but instead, enrich their lives.

Established in 1963, the then Folsom Zoo started with an orphaned cub who was burned in a forest fire, several deer and a coyote. The park eventually grew to what people know it to be today: A haven for animals that cannot be released back into the wild.

The Corti Special at Corti Brothers

Service journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visits Corti Brothers at 5810 Folsom Blvd., Sacramento on May 13, 2023, with $25. The $8.49 Corti Special is on a Dutch crunch roll with provolone cheese, tomatoes, onions and lettuce. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 5810 Folsom Blvd., Sacramento

Is it affordable? You can get a sandwich, chips and a drink for under $15

One of the most popular sandwiches in Sacramento is crafted behind a deli counter in a specialty grocery store on Folsom Boulevard.

The venerable Corti Brothers in East Sacramento was established in 1947 to bring high-quality food and wine from around the world to Northern California. It’s perhaps most well known for its $8.49 Corti Special: customers pick the bread and condiments and the sandwich-makers choose the meat.

Wine tasting at Old Sugar Mill

Location: 35265 Willow Ave, Clarksburg

Is it affordable? You can do it on a budget but winery hopping can get pricey.

Affordable wine tastings in California are possible.

You just have to be willing to go to wineries beyond the Napa Valley.

Roughly a 15-minute drive from downtown Sacramento in Clarksburg sits what used to be a beet sugar refinery. Now, more than 80 years later, Old Sugar Mill houses 14 wineries stocked with zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, barbera, tempranillo, chardonnay, chenin blanc and sangiovese.

Sweet confections at Osaka-Ya

Service journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visits Osaka-Ya at 2215 10th St., Sacramento on July 24, 2023, with $25. The $5 snowcone is a small-sized cup of shaved ice with sour-apple-flavored syrup. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 2215 10th St., Sacramento

Is it affordable? You can do it on a budget. The portions are large.

On a quiet block in Southside Park sits one of the oldest remnants of Sacramento’s Japantown, a destination for shaved ice and authentic Japanese confections.

Osaka-Ya Wagashi — or just Osaka-Ya — was established in 1963. A statue of a black bear dressed in a vest, pants and belt held a “welcome” sign over its head and miscellaneous sticky notes line a wall behind the dessert counter.

The small Japanese storefront on 10th Street sells homemade manju and mochi, but it’s probably most well known for its seasonal snowcones.

Lao food at South Area Market

Service journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visits South Area Market at 5220 Fruitridge Road, Sacramento, on Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023, with $25. She spent roughly half of her budget on pad Thai. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 5220 Fruitridge Road, Sacramento

Is it affordable? You can get a drink, an appetizer and an entree for less than $25.

Past rows of crispy pig ears and imported bath soap, a kitchen in the back of an Asian market in Sacramento is cooking up authentic Lao food you can’t find on Doordash.

South Area Market near the intersection of Stockton Boulevard and Fruitridge Road is unpretentious and personable, from the handwritten menu scribbled on a dry erase board to the minimal decor on the bright yellow cinder-block walls. But don’t let its looks fool you.

The food coming out of this market is some of the best I’ve had in Sacramento.

Caramel corn at Carmazzi

Founder Karen Carmazzi of Carmazzi Caramel Corn at 520 La Sierra Drive, Sacramento, holds bags of her popcorn in October. Service journalism reporter Brianna Taylor visited the family-owned business on a $25 budget as part of The Sacramento Bee’s affordability series. Brianna Taylor/btaylor@sacbee.com

Location: 520 La Sierra Drive, Sacramento

Is it affordable? You could walk away with something on a tight budget.

Just off the intersection of Watt Avenue and Fair Oaks Boulevard sits a Sacramento-based popcorn company that uses a secret family recipe — passed down from generation to generation — to make delicious caramel corn.

Carmazzi Caramel Corn moved its machines to a storefront in Arden Arcade over the summer after operating as a home business for several years. This isn’t your regular ol’ caramel corn, and the customers that shuffled in and out of the store during my visit in November made that clear.

Books at A Seat at The Table

A Seat at the Table has built a devoted following in Elk Grove, leading to the small business being named 2022 Rookie Business of the Year. Cameron Clark/cclark@sacbee.com

Location: 9257 Laguna Springs Drive Suite 130, Elk Grove

Is it affordable? There are a lot of bargains.

Elk Grove has one bookstore and it’s not Barnes and Noble.

A Seat At The Table Books — located off of Highway 99 inside the Laguna Pointe shopping center — makes its mission of inclusivity clear with its queer rights and shop local messaging. It isn’t just a place to snag the Internet’s latest book obsession.

The family-owned bookstore and coffee shop hosts events and panel discussions, poetry and open mic nights, book drives, children’s music classes, story times, book clubs and boozy fairs.

Where should I go next year?

Big or small — let me hear it.

"'Four-time NBA champion Andre Iguodala announced his retirement after 19 seasons on Friday (October 20) during an exclusive interview with Andscape.com's Marc J. Spears.

“It’s just the right time,” Iguodala said. “Time started to get limited for me and I didn’t want to put anything in the back seat. I didn’t want to have to try to delegate time anymore. Especially with on the court, off the court with family. A lot.

“You want to play at a high level. But then family is a lot. My son is 16 and then two girls. So, [I’m] looking forward to seeing them grow up in those important years.”

Iguodala, 39, was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers at No. 9 overall in the 2004 NBA Draft and averaged 15.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game during his eight seasons with the franchise. The former University of Arizona standout was traded to the Denver Nuggets on August 10, 2021 and spent one season with the franchise before signing with the Golden State Warriors in July 2013 during the first of his two stints with the franchise.

Iguodala was a key contributor during the Warriors' four NBA championships, which included being named NBA Finals MVP in 2015. The 39-year-old concludes his NBA career with 11.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game.'",sports,basketball
"'Iron Maiden are finally bringing their Future Past Tour to North America next year. The metal icons announced the exciting news on Friday (October 27), after a memorable set at the Power Trip festival earlier this month.

“We’re really excited to be bringing The Future Past Tour back to Canada and the United States next year,” bassist Steve Harris said in a statement. “We know from the reaction of our fans at Power Trip and the shows we played in Canada recently that they really enjoyed hearing new songs from both Senjutsu and Somewhere In Time, and we’ve really enjoyed playing them!

"'This longstanding favorite served during the fall and winter season is by no means isolated to the Islands, but there’s something unique about Hawaiʻi’s version of the dessert when compared to the other recipes you can search online … Is it the thickness, the texture, the whipped cream cheese frosting? Not sure, but it’s ʻono, for sure.

Every Thanksgiving, Christmas and a few little league baseball game potlucks in between—my mom, like many other local mothers, has been making this classic dessert for as long as I can remember. By this time each year, slices of pumpkin crunch squares would manifest (and then quickly disappear) from the table. When I asked for the recipe, she just laughed, like, hysterically.

“It’s not a family secret recipe or anything!” she insists, saying she probably got it from our Auntie Lani, who in turn likely transcribed it from Sam Choy’s cookbook (neither are sure). She’s trying to downplay it, but I think the point here is, and to quote her, “Remember now, everybody’s mom in Hawaiʻi makes this.” It’s not some big, fancy recipe hidden under lock-and-key. And, that’s probably partly what makes it so good.

Pumpkin Crunch

Prep and cook time: About 1 hour, 20 minutes

Ingredients

1 can of pumpkin (15 oz)

1 can evaporated milk (12 oz)

1 cup sugar

3 eggs

1 box yellow cake mix (15.25 oz)

1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

1 teaspoon cinnamon

2 sticks of butter (one stick is about 8 tablespoons)

parchment paper

silver foil cupcake holders

Frosting

One 8 oz. cream cheese

3/4 cup cool whip

1/2 cup powdered sugar

Preparation

Line a 9 x 12 pan with parchment paper. Mix pumpkin, milk, eggs, cinnamon and sugar. Pour on paper. Pour 1/2 box of yellow cake mix over it. Sprinkle walnuts on cake mix. Layer other 1/2 of cake mix (dry mix straight from the box). Melt butter and spoon over the top evenly. Bake 350-degrees for 50 to 60 minutes. When cool, loosen from side of pan.

"'Next Goal Wins, screengrab via YouTube

Imagine a fish-out-of-water tale about a divorced American who leaves everything behind to travel thousands of miles from home to work with a struggling soccer team. This coach also constantly makes pop culture references. Sounds like Ted Lasso, right? Not quite.

Next Goal Wins is Taika Waititi’s foray into the sports comedy genre. The movie is based on the 2014 documentary of the same name. In 2001, American Samoa lost to Australia by the hard-to-believe score of 31-0 in a qualifying match for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This was the worst defeat in an international history. The documentary Next Goal Wins told the story of how coach Thomas Rongen gave hope to an underdog.

How bad was American Samoa? According to the New York Times, since starting international play in 1994, it was 0-30, losing by a combined score of 229-12, and was tied for last in the FIFA world rankings. But thanks to Rongen, American Samoa finally enjoyed a breakthrough in a prequalifying match for the 2014 World Cup.

The movie Next Goal Wins attempts to recapture that spirit in familiar packaging. Waititi’s puts his spin on it with his trademark quirky sense of humor and storytelling. Some of it works. Some of it doesn’t doesn’t strike the right tone. When the narrative goes awry or feels clumsy, it gives you a greater sense of appreciation for Ted Lasso.

Michael Fassbender plays the role of Rongen. Like Jason Sudeikis’ Lasso, he is confused by local customs, has difficulty connecting with his players, and hides a secret pain that helps explain some of his behaviors. Unlike Sudeikis’ Lasso, Fassbender’s Rongen is a complete lout. He has anger management issues and is just generally surly. This wouldn’t be an issue for the story if the character was more interesting. Don’t blame Fassbender. The script by Waititi and Iain Morris doesn’t work hard enough to portray a more well-rounded character.

The scenes with the most promise should have been those between Fassbender’s Rongen and Kaimana’s Jaiyah Saelua. But even those moments come with a caveat. As the first openly trans athlete to compete in a FIFA World Cup qualifier, Saelua is the most famous member of the real American Samoa team. In the movie, Saelua is played by a non-binary actor. Kaimana gives the film’s best performance. But Waititi misses out on opportunity by focusing too much on Rongen and not enough on Saelua. Some scenes are cringe-worthy and do not do Saelua justice.

Then there is the odd casting choice of Elisabeth Moss as Rongen’s ex-wife Gail. Moss is immensely skilled, but Waititi gives her very little to do. She has limited screen time, and her talents are wasted. Her brief appearances make you wonder if additional scenes were cut.

Waititi probably had the best of intentions when making Next Goal Wins. There are some funny moments—most are early in the movie. For example, when Rongen gets fired, the comic timing of Rhys Darby is perfect. And there are some genuinely warm scenes, such as Rongen’s “inspirational” locker room speech near the end.

Next Goal Wins isn’t a bad sports movie—we want to embrace these long shots. But Waititi’s filmmaking makes it one that’s not always easy to cheer for.'",sports,soccer
"'Usher has received the seal of approval from Super Bowl halftime show royalty: Rihanna.

This year’s halftime show performer had no notes when asked recently if she had any advice for the “Burn” singer as he prepares to take the stage at Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas on Feb. 11.

“I can’t give Usher no advice,” the Super Bowl LVII performer told E! News. “Usher is a natural, he’s a legend, he’s been doing this since he’s a teenager. He’s made for that show. I get excited about entertainers who do this, who are built for it, and he just proved it in Vegas that he’s not going anywhere.”

Usher, who recently wrapped his Sin City residency at Park MGM, re-posted the “Umbrella” singer’s statements on X and responded by writing, “Real recognize real Thank U Queen @rihanna.”

Music Usher to perform at Super Bowl 2024 halftime show R&B star Usher, in the midst of an acclaimed Las Vegas residency, will perform at the NFL’s championship game on Feb. 11 at Vegas’ Allegiant Stadium.

In September, it was announced that the “Caught Up” artist would headline the sporting event’s high-profile music portion, bringing one of the Strip’s most talked-about live acts to the biggest stage in pop music.

“It’s an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list,” Usher said in a September statement about being awarded the highly coveted role. “I can’t wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they’ve seen from me before.”

Last year, Usher launched a residency at Las Vegas’ Park MGM that quickly went viral because of his intimate interactions with famous fans, including Taraji P. Henson, Issa Rae, Saweetie and Keke Palmer. He extended his stay in Sin City through December due to “popular demand” in August.

Earlier this year, Rihanna’s show-stealing performance highlighted the “We Found Love” singer’s musical and visual creativity, while also providing a shocking pregnancy reveal from the pop star.

But the two halftime shows are bound in more ways than just mutual admiration from its performers.

Usher’s Super Bowl performance will be the fifth halftime show overseen by Jay Z’s entertainment company, Roc Nation, following February’s appearance by Rihanna, last year’s hip-hop extravaganza with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J.

"'Why The Lockheed P2V Neptune Aircraft Was Retired After Almost 40 Years In Service

In theory, vehicles of any kind can run indefinitely as long as people are willing to maintain them. Unfortunately, budget and manpower can be limited in the U.S. military, so fleet modernization is necessary to fulfill constantly changing mission requirements in the military. For this reason, however, even some of the most reliable vehicles need to be retired, like the aicraft known as the Lockheed P2V Neptune.

When it first flew in 1945, the Lockheed P2V Neptune was designed for long-range, maritime patrol, and anti-submarine warfare. Manufactured from 1946 to 1961, HistoryNet notes that it's one the ""longest unbroken production runs of any military aircraft.""

In fact, according to the National Cold War Exhibition, the Lockheed P2V Neptune was flown by many aerial forces, not just Americans. Aside from the U.S. Navy, some of its other users were the U.K. Royal Navy, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Royal Australian Air Force.

But what made the Lockheed P2V Neptune so special? And after almost 40 years of service, why was it officially retired for military use in 1984?'",climate,heatwave
"'A WNBA revival in Portland will have to wait, with details of the impasse between the bidding prospective owner and the league office coming to light.

In a report on Thursday, Bill Oram of The Oregonian said that disagreements between Kirk Brown and WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert forced the league to put the expansion process on hold in the city. Oram wrote that the two disagreed on the franchise branding as well as Brown's potential conflict of interest in owning basketball training centers around the country. The latter could be a callback to perceived advantages when New York Liberty owner Joe Tsai paid for chartered flights for his team in 2021 while other teams had travel woes flying commercial.

A source told Oram that it was Brown, not Engelbert, who pulled out of the deal because he felt that there were too many conditions for him to invest money into a team, with some harsh comparisons on how close Portland was to joining.

""Since The Oregonian/OregonLive first reported Wednesday that plans for a new WNBA franchise had fallen through, sources have equated the deal to a football team not scoring from the 1-yard line, Ben Simmons passing up an open layup and a wedding being called off right before “I do.”""

The pause in moving forward with the bid is painful enough for WNBA fans in the region and around the country. Yet putting this dramatic pause in those specific sports terms is absolutely brutal.

Ideally, the addition of a Portland franchise would have taken full advantage of the popularity of women's college basketball on the West Coast, especially in the Pacific Northwest. Though the Pac-12, for all intents and purposes, is done for after this academic year, the conference boasts six Top 25 teams in the first preseason poll. Oregon and Washington produced two of the W's biggest stars in New York's Sabrina Ionescu and Kelsey Plum of the two-time WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces, respectively.

Portland once had a WNBA team, as the Fire played at what's now the Moda Center for three seasons before folding after the 2002 campaign along with the Miami Sol. The WNBA restructured its operations that year as financial troubles were too hard to overcome for some franchises.'",sports,basketball

"'Coaching Clients Through Cybersecurity Governance

An old adage says that everything you need to know in life you learned in kindergarten. Similarly, as a cybersecurity lawyer who also coaches his son’s little league team, I think that the fundamental lessons needed to implement the SEC’s new public company cybersecurity disclosure rules are lessons you learn in little league. So, with this request to introduce myself to BakerHostetler, while discussing a recent interesting development in my practice, I thought of the similarities between my yearly experience coaching my son’s little league team and the recent “tempest” unleashed by the SEC regarding public company cybersecurity disclosures.

With the rapid expansion of cybersecurity regulatory requirements, the corporate board room is about to face its largest forced evolution since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002. Like SOX, the documented and reasonable steps taken by boards of directors before a security incident occurs will form a key defense against director liability claims, government investigations, regulatory enforcement, and plaintiff/shareholder and third-party litigation. I coach my clients through these developments the same way I coach my players in little league – by emphasizing teamwork, process, and consequences.

Teamwork

In any Hollywood movie about ragtag sports teams, the emphasis is on teamwork. In little league, a significant part of early practices is learning how to cheer on your teammates. Every kid has the opportunity (and responsibility) to bat, and ultimately your team is only as good as your weakest player. Similarly, cyber governance is now a team game. As Harvard Business Review noted, “[t]o provide proper oversight and comply with the regulatory environment, board members are going to have to up their cybersecurity game. It’s no longer adequate to just hear about the protections put in place.” The entire management team and board now have a chance at bat and will need to understand and encourage the cyber corporate strategy, cyber risk profile, and cyber mitigation steps that their organization is undertaking. To underscore the point, the New York State Department of Financial Services recently enacted a rule that requires boards to “exercise oversight of the covered entity’s cybersecurity risk management, including by having sufficient understanding of cybersecurity-related matters to exercise such oversight.” The successful organization (read: regulatory-compliant organization) will treat cybersecurity risk management as the ultimate team game.

Process

In little league, I emphasize with the kids that they control the process, not the outcome. When faced with the slumped shoulders of a kid who repeatedly swings and misses, I remind them to focus on the process – a clean, simple, and repeatable swing – not the outcome. In much the same way, advising senior management and boards requires a constant reiteration to focus on the process implemented before a cyber incident. To quote the SEC’s Interpretive Guidance, “we have also substituted the term ‘processes’ because the term ‘processes’ more fully [en]compasses registrants’ cybersecurity practices.” In short, this regulator is concerned about the actions prior to an incident rather than whether a security incident occurred. As noted in a post on the FTC’s business blog, “data security begins with the Board of Directors, not the IT Department. A corporate board that prioritizes data security can set the tone throughout an organization by instilling a culture of security, establishing strong security expectations, and breaking down internal silos to facilitate technical and strategic collaboration.”

Consequences

One of the greatest “joys” of coaching young kids is the inevitable moment a young player realizes that baseball bats are dual-use instruments – equally effective for swinging at baseballs and swinging at each other as light sabers. Every year, I take a knee and explain to a young Luke Skywalker the serious and potentially long-term consequences of hitting a teammate with a metal baseball bat. The FTC similarly recently reminded management teams about the consequences of thoughtlessly swinging their way through cybersecurity. Just this past January, the FTC finalized an enforcement action against Drizly, the alcohol delivery company, and Drizly’s CEO. Most concerning (for management teams anyway) is that the consent order will follow the CEO to any new organization for the next 10 years. Now, as this shows, the consequences of decisions made in the context of cybersecurity enterprise risk management are far-reaching and long-lasting for all members of the management team.

Many management teams remain in the early innings of the journey to meet the shifting kaleidoscope of regulatory requirements. For a firm, this presents a unique opportunity to deepen relationships with existing clients because cybersecurity regulatory risk cuts across industries, corporation size, and types of organizations and also creates regular, routine, and repeated client interaction points. I’m impressed by the collective talents, ability and practical-minded solutions surrounding me in the Digital Assets & Data Management Practice Group, and I look forward to cross-group collaboration to drive effective solutions for our clients.

As a native New Yorker (go Yankees!), when I am not corralling little leaguers, I’m fixated on urban policy as a big booster of the city – contributing to the Partnership for New York as a Rockefeller Fellow and recently concluding my service on the Landmarks & Preservation Committee for Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan. In addition, I have a deep interest in education and educational policy and serve as a trustee and the board secretary of the Hackley School. Finally, for those who have made it this far, I’m also happy to share the places to find the best Ghanaian jollof here in the city.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Two men play with a ball in the placid sea; a woman practices yoga where the water meets the hot sand. No one looks back — at the hellscape that starts a few beach-towel lengths away.

The black bones of pine trees and scrub stretch inland as far as the eye reaches, marking the course of a major wildfire on the Greek resort island of Rhodes. At this point near Gennadi village, its climate change-fueled fury was only quenched by the sea. Up to a tenth of the island was affected, and authorities had to evacuate 19,000 tourists from their hotels.

Even for a country used to seeing forests burn every summer, Greece’s deadly blazes during a July heatwave were unusually bad; despite a huge mobilization, the Rhodes fire raged for 11 days.

Climate change left a painful imprint on much of Europe in 2023, as the northern hemisphere sweltered through its hottest summer on record. The United Nations weather agency expects 2023 to also set a global heat record, and warns of a potential future of increasing floods, wildfires, glacier melt and heat waves.

Just weeks after massive wildfires hit southern Europe, rainstorms of rare intensity triggered deadly floods. Nevertheless, increasingly hot and dry weather caused northeastern Spain’s worst-recorded drought, which drove officials in November to tighten water restrictions. The year had started inauspiciously, with high temperatures leaving much of the Alps bereft of snow.

Unsurprisingly, it was also a year of protests over global warming. These included disruptions by climate activists who blocked traffic and glued themselves to things like busy roads and paintings in museums. Such tactics proved unpopular in several countries, with Britain granting its police new powers against similar forms of activism.

In October, London police arrested Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and other protesters trying to block access to an oil and gas conference. Thunberg, who inspired a global youth movement demanding stronger efforts to fight climate change, had previously been twice fined in Sweden for disobeying police during an environmental protest.

But the year's deadliest disaster struck in Turkey and neighboring Syria. On a cold February night, a magnitude 7.8 quake leveled swathes of buildings, killing at least 50,000 people. The scale of the destruction was largely blamed on poor adherence to building construction rules.

And death continued to stalk Ukraine, where the war started by Russia's full-scale invasion entered its second year in February. Despite a much-heralded counter-offensive by Western-armed Ukrainian forces, the fighting crepitated into a World War I-style quagmire.

Alarmed by its eastern neighbor Russia's belligerence, Finland abandoned decades of neutrality to join NATO in April. Months later, Helsinki accused Moscow of retaliating by channeling hundreds of migrants to enter Finland through the frigid 830-mile (1,340-kilometer) border. Neighboring Sweden's NATO bid has so far been frustrated by fence-sitting from alliance members Turkey and Hungary.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia sought a better life in Europe, with Italy topping migrant arrivals — nearly 153,000 by Dec. 3. Southern European countries remained the main points of entry with 250,000 arrivals, the most since 2016.

According to the U.N., more than 2,600 migrants died trying to reach Europe, mostly by sea from northern Africa and Turkey. In June, a rusty trawler crammed with up to 750 people sank off Greece, as it was heading from Libya to Italy. Just over 100 people survived — all men — while hundreds of women and children are thought to have perished, trapped in the holds.

Britain saw a new record in arrivals, as in November the country's Supreme Court scotched a controversial plan by the conservative government to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda. Italy, meanwhile, struck a deal in a similar spirit with non-European Union member Albania.

The EU itself is still trying to agree on overhauling its dated asylum rules, after years of hand-wringing and acrimony between countries where migrants arrive and countries where they want to settle.

Migration figured strong in November's Dutch elections, won by Geert Wilders ′ far-right Party for Freedom. Other noteworthy elections were in Poland, which lurched from right to center, Slovakia, where populists won on a pro-Russian, anti-American platform, and Turkey, whose long-ruling strongman Recep Tayyip Erdogan dispatched an opposition alliance.

Turkey also witnessed a rare, for Europe, rally celebrating the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Pro-Palestinian — and pro-Israeli — marches were held in several countries, as Europeans bickered over other peoples' suffering.

Britain got a new — unelected — head of state when Charles III was crowned in May. He's the first British monarch with that name since the time of the Stewarts.

Finally, the millions of Europeans who died in 2023 — mostly of heart disease — included former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who made a point of enjoying life, and Czech writer Milan Kundera, who helped countless others enjoy theirs.'",climate,heatwave

"'Sempra Energy headquarters in downtown San Diego. REUTERS/Mike Blake

San Diego utility-holding company Sempra on Thursday topped estimates for quarterly profit on strength in its energy infrastructure business, sending its shares up 2.3% in early trading.

Sempra infrastructure, the company’s unit for building, operating and investing in the infrastructure critical for the clean energy transition, posted third-quarter earnings of $223 million, almost double of $114 million reported last year.

The segment got a boost from increasing global interest in lower emissions fuels, which have received a push under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that provides incentives and credits for such projects.

Earnings in the Sempra Texas utilities unit rose about 19% to $305 million as the segment benefited from the heatwave that hit parts of the U.S., including its key operating region Texas.

Warmer and colder weather in service areas benefits utility companies as it increases the demand for gas and electricity.

A total of 20,000 new premises were added to the company’s service territory during the quarter, Sempra said.

The company, which is the parent of San Diego Gas & Electric, said it also expects to meet or surpass the high end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast range of $4.30 to $4.60.

“The directional raise is consistent with the upside we highlighted into the quarter and continues the beat and raise track record that Sempra has established over the past few years,” J.P.Morgan analysts said in a note.

On an adjusted basis, U.S. power and gas utility Sempra reported per-share earnings of $1.08, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.01 per share.'",climate,forest fire

By H. Sterling Burnett

The Kansas City Star ran an opinion piece claiming climate change is already making weather more extreme in Kansas and Missouri. This is false. There is no data supporting the claim that either flooding or drought, two specific extreme weather events cited in the story, are worse now than they have been historically. Almost all the records for such events in both states were set nearly a century or more ago, when global average temperatures were cooler.

Joel Mathis, the writer of the Kansas City Star story, “We’re watching the climate change in Kansas and Missouri. Why don’t more of us care?,” opines:

Climate change is already taking a toll on Kansas and Missouri, and not just in the form of wintertime vegetation. Both states are enduring long-running droughts that have challenged the region’s farmers and forced some communities to start hoarding their drinking water. That’s probably just the beginning. … Climate change is going to make the extremes more extreme — more intense rain and snowstorms, but also more extended periods of drought. Our big swings will get bigger and more destructive.

But Mathis’ sees an even worse problem, in particular, that the majority of people aren’t that concerned about climate change.

“Last week, Heatmap News reported its new poll found that Midwesterners are ‘consistently blasé about climate change,’” writes Mathis. “Fifty-two percent of folks in our region — a slim majority, but a majority nonetheless — say warming ‘poses little or no risk to their region.’”

The residents of those two states are right to be unconcerned about climate change making their states’ respective weather worse, since historical evidence and data show that neither drought nor flooding amid recent decades of modest warming are worse than they have been historically. Indeed, as Mathis himself notes, Kansas and Missouri are not strangers to droughts, floods, and rapidly changing weather extremes.

“The Midwest is already a ‘high variability’ weather region,” writes Mathis, who discussed this fact with Chuck Rice, a professor of soil microbiology at Kansas State University who served on the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. “Think about all the times you’ve heard the joke that if you don’t like the weather around here ‘just wait five minutes.’”

Although it is true that parts of Kansas and Missouri are currently suffering from various degrees of drought, it is not a long-term drought, nor is it historically severe. A short-term drought is no evidence of climate change. Droughts in the early and mid-twentieth century, 70 and 90 years of global warming ago, were more prolonged and severe than the droughts experienced in either state since the beginning of the 21st century. Since official record keeping began, Kansas and Missouri both experienced their most sustained droughts in the 1930s, only to both also experience a sustained drought again in the 1950s. Longer term records developed from proxy data show even more severe and sustained droughts, multiple decades long, have not been uncommon throughout the region’s history.

Figure 1. Western Kansas annual droughts during past 1,000 years. The vertical axis is the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The more negative the PDSI, the drier (orange). On the opposite side, the more positive the PDSI, the wetter (dark green). Data obtained from Cook et al. 2004, Science 306 (5698):1015-1018. https://climate.k-state.edu/news/stories/2016/06/climate_basics_5/image1.gif

What’s true of drought across Kansas and Missouri is also true of excessive rainfall and flooding. Kansas experienced its worst flood in 1844; Missouri’s largest recorded flood was 1785, with the flood year of 1844 being its second greatest flood. More costly damage has been done by floods in both Missouri and Kansas since then, in 1903, 1951, 1993, 1998, and 2007. But the reason that more people and property were harmed by the more recent floods is not higher rainfall totals or deeper flood waters, but rather purely demographics. More people and development had taken place in the areas flooded than existed in the 19th and early 20th centuries when heavier flooding occurred. Neither recent rainfall totals nor floodwater depth have been greater in the 21st century than in the past.

Neither a single flood event, no matter how severe, nor single instances of drought, no matter how widely covered in the media, are evidence climate change is making weather in Kansas or Missouri worse or less predictable. Only a long-term sustained trend of either or both types of weather events might implicate climate change in weather changes, but there are no such worsening trends for either state. In short, data provide no evidence that climate change is making weather worse in Kansas or Missouri, so residents there are displaying common sense when they downplay the threat of climate change in their lives. The media should follow the public’s lead on this point. Follow the science, Mathis and the Kansas City Star, rather than hyping a false climate alarm narrative.

"'HOUSTON — No matter the place or the moment, the Texas Rangers are rolling right now.

TUESDAY’S GAME NLCS GAME 2 WHO: Arizona Diamondbacks (Kelly) at Philadelphia Phillies (Nola) WHEN: 8:07 p.m. Tuesday TELEVISION: TBS

Jonah Heim homered, Nathan Eovaldi pitched six effective innings and Texas beat Framber Valdez and the Houston Astros 5-4 on Monday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series.

The Rangers improved to 7-0 in the playoffs, including six wins on the road. They swept the Rays in the Wild Card Series and the Orioles in the Division Series, and then posted a 2-0 win at Houston in the ALCS opener.

“It’s just baseball to us,” Texas third baseman Josh Jung said. “We’re jumping on teams early, and that helps us settle in. Our pitching has been outstanding. You can’t ask for anything more than what they’ve given us.”

Adolis García, Mitch Garver and Nathaniel Lowe each hit an RBI single during Texas’ four-run first inning against Valdez, and José Leclerc closed it out for the Rangers after Yordan Alvarez powered an Astros rally.

Eovaldi struck out nine, including two in a row after Houston loaded the bases with none out in the fifth. He was charged with three runs and five hits in his third win this postseason.

“You’re talking about one of the elite pitchers in the game,” Texas Manager Bruce Bochy said. “They have that ability to turn up a notch when they had to. We made an error, bases loaded, and it’s about picking each other up, and he picked us up there and made great pitches.”

Game 3 of the best-of-seven series is Wednesday night in Arlington.

The Rangers are the fifth team in MLB history and first since the Astros last season to win their first seven postseason games. Kansas City holds the record with an eight-game win streak to start the 2014 postseason.

The six straight road playoff wins by the Rangers is tied for the second-longest such streak in MLB history, behind an eight-game streak by the Yankees in 1996.

Alvarez hit two solo drives to become the sixth player in MLB history to have two multihomer games in one postseason. The second one was off Aroldis Chapman, trimming Houston’s deficit to 5-4 with two out in the eighth.

Leclerc then came in and walked José Abreu and Michael Brantley, but Chas McCormick grounded out to end the threat.

Jeremy Peña flied out to deep right field for the first out in the Houston ninth. Yainer Diaz then grounded out and Jose Altuve flied to center, giving Leclerc his second save of the series.

The Astros, who went 39-42 at home in the regular season, continued to struggle at Minute Maid Park. The defending champions fell to 1-3 at home in the playoffs this year.

The Rangers jumped all over Valdez. Marcus Semien smacked the first pitch to center field for a single. Corey Seager singled to left on the second pitch before Valdez made two errors on one play.

Valdez bobbled a chopper hit by Robbie Grossman for an error that allowed him to reach first and Semien to score. His second error occurred when he badly overthrew first to move Grossman to second and Seager to third.

Valdez put his hands on his knees and shook his head at the end of the play.

García then hit a liner to right field to score Seager. Garver singled home another run before Valdez finally got his first out when he struck out Heim.

The Rangers weren’t done yet.

Lowe singled on a ground ball to left to make it 4-0. Valdez retired the next two batters to end the inning.

“I thought my pitches were good,” he said through a translator. “Maybe they got a little bit lucky. There were a couple of balls that weren’t hit that well for base hits.”

Alex Bregman also homered for the Astros, who went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position. Alvarez, who is dealing with an illness, looked much better than he did in Game 1 when he went 0 for 4 with three strikeouts.

He said he was feeling good Monday and deflected questions about his health.

“It was just something personal,” he said through a translator. “I don’t know how that got out. It didn’t come from me or the team.”

Valdez (0-2) allowed seven hits and five runs – four earned – in 2 2/3 innings in his second loss this postseason. It was his shortest start of the season.

The Astros missed a huge opportunity in the fifth. Brantley and McCormick hit back-to-back singles to open the inning before Peña reached on an error by Jung.

But Eovaldi escaped by striking out pinch-hitter Diaz and Altuve before Bregman grounded out.

“When I was ahead 1-2 (on Altuve) and I went with a high fastball and followed it up with the splitter. You’re close but you’re not out of the woods yet because Bregman is equally as talented,” Eovaldi said. “I was able to make a good pitch and get us out of the jam, and I felt like that was one of the turning points of the game.”

Alvarez walked with one out in the sixth before scoring on a two-out double by Brantley. Alvarez also hit a leadoff homer in the second into the second deck in right field.

Heim homered high off the wall in left field to push the lead to 5-1 with no outs in the third.

NLCS: Bryce Harper smashed the first pitch he saw on his 31st birthday into the seats, Kyle Schwarber hit his first homer of the postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Philadelphia Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series in Philadelphia.

Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate. Harper, who also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs, hit his 10th homer in two postseasons with the Phillies.

Zack Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending National League champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.

José Alvarado got four big outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the postseason after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.

The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving, deliriously-cheering fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave fans a reason to stop – or a chance for Arizona to catch its breath until it was too late.

Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen’s first pitch 420 feet into the right-field seats. There was some minor consternation that Schwarber – with 47 homers this season and 93 over the last two – had yet to go deep through six playoff games. How easy it was to forget that Schwarber didn’t hit any in the Wild Card Series or NLDS last season before he launched six in the NLCS and World Series. So those Schwarbombs might just be getting started.

Four pitches later, Harper homered – the first time in 127 postseason games Philadelphia went deep twice in the first inning.

When Castellanos lined his fifth homer of the playoffs in the third – all in the past three games – it gave the Phillies 32 home runs in 13 postseason games at Citizens Bank Park over the last two years.

The Kelce Bros approved. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce – minus celebrity friend Taylor Swift – and Eagles center Jason Kelce went wild. Travis pointed to his brother as Jason pounded a beer in their suite.

Gallen, a South Jersey native, had his name derisively drawn out to “Galll-ennnn” by Phillies fans each time the 17-game winner got into a jam. Too many times, for Arizona.

Trea Turner hit a one-double in the third, leaving first base open. Gallen pitched to Harper instead of walking him and got burned by an RBI single for a 4-0 lead.

J.T. Realmuto added an RBI single in the fifth.

Those runs proved crucial for the Phillies. Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run homer off Wheeler in the fifth that made it 5-2.

Seranthony Domínguez opened the door in the seventh for the Diamondbacks when his throwing error on a comebacker led to an unearned run. Alvarado retired pinch-hitter Emmanuel Rivera on a groundout to keep it 5-3 and tossed a scoreless eighth.

NOTES

RANGERS: Max Scherzer will start Game 3 of the AL Championship Series for the Texas Rangers against the Houston Astros on Wednesday night.

Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, has been out since Sept. 12 because of a muscle strain in his shoulder.

PHILLIES: Bryce Harper wants to take a swing at the Olympics.

The Philadelphia Phillies slugger said it would be a dream to play for Team USA when baseball returns for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Harper, who turned 31 on Monday, has long been an advocate of MLB taking a break during the season to let major leaguers play in the Olympics.

Harper said his wife texted him a happy birthday message attached to news about baseball’s return.

“You talk about growing the game, and that’s the way you grow it at the highest peak,” Harper said. “You let guys that are playing in the league take that break just like in the NHL and see what happens. I think it would be really cool. I think it would be a lot of fun. I don’t know if they’ll ever go for it, but I would love to put USA on my chest and represent it at the highest level.”

"'The city of Portland’s bid for a WNBA team has fallen through according to the Oregonian’s Bill Oram.

BREAKING: Plans to bring a WNBA team to Portland have fallen through, sources say, and it is unclear whether millionaire entrepreneur Kirk Brown remains involved with the city's bid. https://t.co/iuOvsOPttJ — Bill Oram (@billoram) November 1, 2023

This report of the plan falling through come about a month after it was reported by The Athletic that Portland was under strong consideration for a WNBA franchise.

According to Oram, a major sticking point in the plans, outlined in a letter WNBA Commissioner Cathy Englebert sent to Ron Wyden, was a proposed renovation of the Moda Center that would take place during a WNBA season.

In her letter, Engelbert cited plans for renovations to Moda Center, the home of the Trail Blazers, as a sticking point. She said the renovations, “anticipated to take place during consecutive summers” had led to the decision to hold off on expanding to Portland “until the timing and scope of arena improvements are settled.”

Despite the setback, a representative for Wyden reinforced his commitment to bringing a WNBA franchise to Portland.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Wyden said, “Sen. Wyden is committed to continue working hard with everybody in Portland who’s teaming up to bring our city and state a WNBA franchise.

"'The National Weather Service warned of ""extremely large breaking waves"" in southern Oregon.

PORTLAND, Ore. — The National Weather Service has issued high surf warnings for much of the West Coast and parts of Hawaii, describing the waves and rip currents expected to hit certain coastlines as potentially dangerous and life-threatening.

The warnings were in place Wednesday for parts of Oregon and Hawaii. The weather service warned that waves of up to 25 feet during the day could morph into ""dangerously large breaking waves"" of up to 35 feet along Oregon's southern coast by night, creating hazardous conditions and the potential for significant beach erosion.

In Hawaii, the agency expected high surf between roughly 20 and 30 feet and powerful rip currents to affect the northern and western shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu and Molokai and the north shore of Maui. It warned of ocean water surging and sweeping across beaches and potentially damaging roadways and coastal infrastructure.

The high surf warning was set to be in place until Thursday night in southern Oregon and until early Friday morning in Hawaii.

Christmas at the beach? Dangerous high surf today and through Thursday December 28th. Avoid jetties and logs near the waterline. Basically, if you're at the beach, pay attention to the waves.

A coastal flood advisory was also in effect Wednesday morning through the afternoon for much of the Washington state coastline. The weather service said minor flooding around high tide could affect shorelines and low-lying coastal areas. A high surf advisory that forecast large breaking waves topping 20 feet was set to take effect Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon.

The rough ocean conditions were expected to hit California later Wednesday, starting with the state's northern coast before affecting its southern shores beginning early Thursday.

The weather service said waves of up to 32 feet that may be ""erratic and unpredictable"" could spark ""life-threatening surf conditions"" along the coast in northern California's Humboldt and Mendocino counties starting Wednesday night.

A high surf warning impacting San Francisco down to Big Sur is set to take effect in the early hours of Thursday. The weather service said ""everyone should remain out of the water"" because of the hazardous conditions. A coastal flood advisory for the region was already in place Wednesday morning and was set to last until early Friday.

From San Luis Obispo down to Santa Barbara on California's central coast, the most dangerous surf conditions were expected on Thursday, the weather service said. Life-threatening rip currents that ""pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning"" and waves up to 25 feet were expected.'",climate,flood
"'The main risk of damaging winds and isolated tornadoes exists late Saturday into early Sunday. Widespread heavy rain is also in the forecast.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The weekend is going to be soggy with the potential for severe storms and coastal flooding across the Tampa Bay area.

As the system we've been tracking all week in the Gulf finally arrives Saturday morning, the rain begins. A storm system will move onshore near Tampa, which will bring us strong to potentially severe storms this weekend.

The severe weather potential includes isolated tornadoes, gusty winds, lightning and flooding — all starting Saturday afternoon through overnight Sunday. The forecast indicates that is when the majority of the severe weather threat will happen.

The 10 Weather team is here to keep you informed, prepared and connected through any severe weather. Download our free 10 Tampa Bay app to get the latest live radar and storm coverage.

Here's the breakdown of what you need to know this weekend:

Florida's storm timing

As early as 9 a.m. Saturday, expect areas of scattered rain and gusty winds. Bottom line — if you want to avoid heavy downpours and worsening weather conditions, finish any outdoor activities or travel in the morning and be ready to move indoors.

Around the midafternoon hours Saturday, the threat of severe storms begins. The low-pressure system begins to approach Florida's West Coast, and we see our first strong bands of wind and rain move through.

Then around 8 p.m. Saturday through the overnight hours, the system will push onshore bringing us the greatest potential for isolated tornadoes and severe weather. Sunday morning into the afternoon, the storm system leaves our area. In terms of rainfall, we'll see major improvements and start drying out by noon Sunday.

By Monday morning, we finally return to normal with partly cloudy to mostly sunny skies.

Severe weather and flooding impacts

There is a level two out of five risk for severe weather for most of the Tampa Bay area. Areas leading to the Nature Coast are at a level one, or marginal risk.

The main impacts will be gusty winds between 35-45 mph and isolated tornadoes. Additionally, between 2-3 inches of expected rain could lead to flooding and lightning. Coastal flooding is likely on Sunday.

Tampa Bay-area coastal flooding

Tides will generally be 2-3 feet above normal and the entire state of Florida can expect some flooding and abundant amounts of rainfall this weekend. As our wind pattern shifts on Sunday, coastal flooding will be an issue.

In anticipation of flooding, a coastal flood advisory is in effect from 7 p.m. Saturday through 7 a.m. Sunday from Citrus County southward to Manatee County. Minor coastal flooding is expected, with the flooding of lots, parks and roads possible.

It won't be a good day to get into the Gulf, with large waves up to 6 feet possible.

"'GE Vernova’s Hydro Power business has completed the commissioning of the four 175 MW Francis hydropower turbines and generators at the Zungeru project in Nigeria.

Located on the Kadina River in Niger State, the 700 MW Zungeru project is the second largest hydropower plant in Nigeria, and is expected to meet around 10% of Nigeria’s total domestic electricity requirements, with renewable and reliable energy. The site will also help in controlling floods and support irrigation for the region.

GE Vernova was selected by the EPC company, China National Electrical Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), to design, supply, supervise installation, and commission the four hydropower units.

Brian Selby, Hydro Power Asia Leader, GE Vernova, said: “Nigeria is gifted with large rivers and natural falls that create opportunities for hydropower development. As the Government of Nigeria continues to pursue the expansion of generation capacity and extend the capability of its power grid, we are happy to help take advantage of the country’s water reserves to meet its increasing demand for sustainable, reliable, and efficient power. This project will have a wide-reaching impact on the country’s energy landscape. The Zungeru project received investment support from Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) of China and we are pleased to see it come to life.”

According to the International Hydropower Association (IHA), the total exploit-able potential of hydropower in Nigeria is estimated at over 14 GW and hydropower remains essential to help accelerate the energy transition.

"'Starting in January, aspiring firefighters will have a new place to train in Colorado Springs.

Thanks to a collaboration between Black Forest Fire Rescue, Monument Fire District and Pikes Peak State College, a new fire training academy will be able to graduate 15 fully certified firefighters in a four-month program.

The program meets a training need for both departments, said Monument Chief Andy Kovacs, who said that small departments like his in past years sent new recruits to other departments’ training academies.

Kovacs said that recently, retirement turnover among fire departments has reduced the number of spots open at existing training academies. The new academy will allow Black Forest and Monument to replenish trained staff more quickly, he said.

“They [Colorado Springs Fire Department Officer Academy] already had quite a few firefighting recruits going through their academy, so that was the thrust or the initiative to have to create something different.”

Of the first class of 15, Monument will send nine new firefighters for training, according to Kovacs.

“Obviously, we couldn’t wait a whole year to get them either into the Colorado Springs Academy or into the West Metro Academy, so that why this is so exciting for us, because we can continue to do everything we need to do,” said Kovacs.

Academy director Jamie Gutschick said that both fire department recruits and Pikes Peak State students will have access to the program.

Previously, Pikes Peak State College offered a course designed to help prepare students for full firefighting training upon recruitment. The more robust fire academy will allow graduates to start immediately, Gutschick said.

“This is just ramped up a little bit more, and I think the reason for that is because of the involvement of the new hires of the fire departments,” he said. “They have got to be ready to go.”

The course will be taught at the Black Forest Fire and Rescue building, where students will go through practical training including live fire exercises, according to Gutschick.

While new Monument and Black Forest recruits take up most of the inaugural class, other students are welcome to apply. Deputy Chief Chris Piepenburg of Black Forest Fire and Rescue said that he hoped the new program will have far-reaching benefits.

“I think this is going to be a great new endeavor for all the organizations we have now, and it’s going to be an adventure in seeing what we can do with the rest of the county and the rest of the agencies around us,” he said.'",climate,heatwave
"'The Great British Bake Off contestants faced sweltering conditions inside the tent during Wednesday (18 October) night’s episode.

As often seems to be the case, the bakers took on Chocolate Week during heatwave temperatures – with the series being filmed in Berkshire during the height of summer.

Rowan excelled in the Signature challenge, which tasked bakers with putting their own spin on a chocolate torte.

However, during the Technical, which saw contestants attempt to create eight cheesecakes complete with a blackcurrant compote and white chocolate topping, Tasha fell ill.

A medic then comes over and tells Tasha to breathe slowly before escorting her out of the tent.

She was then comforted outside by host Alison Hammond as it was confirmed that she would have to withdraw from that episode.

Health first. Always.

A participation officer from Bristol, Tasha is joined on the show by Daryl, her sign language interpreter.

As a result of Tasha leaving, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith announced their decision to suspend eliminations until next week; however, two bakers will be sent home in that episode.

On X, fans complained about the decision to hold Chocolate Week during hot weather.

“You’ve got to give it to the #GBBO producers for always managing to schedule chocolate week during the hottest week of the year. 10/10 they never miss,” one fan wrote.

“After years of heat in the tent maybe the daft producers could invest in aircon?” another posited.

“Isn’t it just uncanny how filming chocolate week in #GBBO always coincides with the hottest day of the year? In a tent,” a third wrote. “Disaster by design. I love this show, but I wish they wouldn’t do this. Better to see what the bakers can do in normal conditions.”

Meanwhile, Hammond, who replaced Matt Lucas as presenter this year, was praised for supporting Tasha.

“Alison is a good egg,” one person wrote. “As a migraine sufferer, I feel very sorry for Tasha!”

“Aww, poor Tasha. Love how caring Alison is,” said another.

"'SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash. — Steady, relentless rain led to flooded streets and homes along the Stillaguamish River. The river hit its highest level around 9 a.m., cresting at 17 and a half feet. An hour later, at 10 a.m. the Snohomish County Department of Emergency Management deemed the Stillaguamish at major flood stage. A homeowner who lives adjacent to the South Fork said his home started to flood around 4 a.m.

“I got up immediately and we just started putting towels down in front of the doors, putting tarps down in front of the doors as well, trying to do anything to keep that seal to keep that water from coming in. We shut all the circuit panels down, had to go kill the power to my hot tub just so we don’t short circuit the house or anything like that,” said Curtin Babbs.

He and others also said at times, all they could do was sit and watch the water take out whatever was in its way.

“The flow of the river on the road matches the one on the actual river and there’s logs floating by, mailboxes and bins, propane tanks all that stuff,” said Babbs. “That was actually really scary honestly, just seeing basically a river on my sideyard.”

“Logs, trees, I’ve seen a couch go by with lawn furniture on it,” said Kathy Grooms, who lives a little over a mile away with the river rushing directly behind her home.

Grooms’ garage completely flooded, with only about a foot of space left above the water.

“You can see it is probably about 15 inches down maybe less. You can see where there is the watermark. I’ll be out of power until this goes down. Hopefully, I’ve got some friends who will let me come over and shower,” she said.

Just this fall, she began to prepare for her first flood season in her riverside home.

“It did go up my stairwell. I happened to put in a door just preparing for a flood because you never know when it’s going to happen. It didn’t go all the way up the stairwell, it went about five steps up versus filling up the whole hallway so it did help,” said Grooms.

She also told us that she has flood insurance but was left speechless when she learned she’d have to fork up a $10,000 deductible to use it.

“It’s really kind of a shame that flood insurance, the deductible is $10k, and at $10,000 it’s just such a rip-off, I’m sorry.”

Grooms’ neighbors have power and have been helping her charge her phone and bringing her what she needs from town.

The Snohomish County Department of Emergency Management said right now, it’s too early to tell how many homes were affected in Tuesday’s flooding.

"'Southern Grampians Shire Council is reminding residents that a permit is required before carrying out any works within a council road reserve.

A road reserve is the area between the road and a property boundary and generally includes the road shoulder, nature strip and footpath.

Council's Director Infrastructure and Sustainability Marg Scanlon said instances where residents should apply for a permit to work within a road reserve included:

- Using machinery on a road reserve to carry out works to property ie landscaping.

- Building or renewing a driveway and/or crossover.

- Building a new property boundary structure like a retaining wall.

- Planting a tree on a nature strip, or anything higher than 500mm.

- Ms Scanlon said that under the Road Management Act 2004 (Schedule 7) it was an offence for works to be carried out within a road reserve without a permit from the relevant authority.

""Council is responsible for ensuring that council owned and maintained roads are safe and functional for all road users,"" she said. ""We also need to protect the integrity of infrastructure like kerb and channel, culverts, signage and pedestrian treatments.""

Ms Scanlon said there had been cases in the past 12 months where residents in the shire had not applied for the permit.

""Some of the breaches unfortunately resulted in damage to roadside drainage infrastructure, which led to water logging in road shoulders. In some instances, edges have broken off the roads from machinery damage or from poor engineering of driveway cross-overs. Even using the wrong type of material in construction creates problems.""

Ms Scanlon added that planting the wrong type of tree on a nature strip could cause a hazard for motorists and damage to public infrastructure.

""It's important for council to review the species, proposed location and size of the tree before planting to reduce the risk of the tree impacting the line of sight for motorists and other road users.""

To mitigate future breaches of the Act, Council is increasing its surveillance of third party works in road reserves (including service connections) to check if permits had been granted.

If in doubt or to apply for a permit, please call Council on 5573 0444 or visit www.sthgrampians.vic.gov.au and go to Services, then Roads & Infrastructure then scroll down to Works Within Road Reserves.'",climate,flood
"'The Aces defeated the Liberty 3-1 to uniquely repeat as WNBA Finals champions as A'ja Wilson earned her first Finals MVP award.

The Las Vegas Aces won the 2023 WNBA Finals. They put on a stellar performance and beat the New York Liberty three games to one. The Aces repeat as champions after winning the 2022 Finals, putting themselves in historic company. Las Vegas is the third team in history to win consecutive WNBA titles, per ESPN Stats & Info. In addition, A'ja Wilson's 3rd career playoff game with 20 points and 15 rebounds (a WNBA record) is the first in a title-clinching win. How did they manage to pull it off?

The Aces make WNBA history as repeat champions

The headline of the WNBA Playoffs has been A'ja Wilson. She averaged 23.8 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.5 blocks, 1.3 steals, and a blistering 50% for three-pointers during the postseason. She imposed her will on the Liberty all series and closed out Game 4 with a double-double of 24 points and 11 rebounds. Naturally, she was the WNBA Finals MVP.

The New York Liberty had tantalizing talent of their own. New York was led by regular-season MVP Breanna Stewart. Like Wilson, Stewart averaged impressive numbers throughout the postseason. In the Liberty's lone win in the Finals, she had a stat line of 24 points, 12 rebounds, and 4 assists.

The Liberty had great help from Jonquel Jones during the series. She scored in the double digits in three Finals games. New York had plenty of talent, but the missing piece was Sabrina Ionescu. Ionescu averaged 17 points per game during the regular season but only scored in the double-digits twice during the WNBA Finals.

Both teams had a wealth of depth, but the Aces' stars shined brighter and put the Liberty's fire out. This highly anticipated Finals matchup was one of the most exciting in recent history. If Las Vegas can bring everyone back, there is a strong chance they can make more history next season.'",sports,basketball
"'The Bureau of Meteorology has declared an El Niño event this summer, the first in Australia since 2015 - meaning it's time to plan for high temperatures in the coming months.

It's important to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to prevent heat-related illnesses. Here are some ways to help you beat the heat and stay safe this summer.

Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water throughout the day and avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, as these can contribute to dehydration. Stay cool indoors. If the heat becomes unbearable, seek refuge in air-conditioned spaces like malls, libraries or community centres. Dress for the weather. Choose lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing to help keep your body cool. A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses provide additional protection from the sun. Plan activities wisely. Avoid strenuous activities and schedule outdoor activities during the cooler parts of the day, like early morning or evening. Seek shade. When outdoors, make use of shaded areas or umbrellas to escape direct sunlight. This can significantly reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses like heatstroke. Never leave anyone in a parked vehicle. Leaving children, animals or vulnerable individuals in a parked car, even for a few minutes, can be life-threatening. Always check your vehicle before locking it. Check on vulnerable individuals (and pets too!) to ensure they are coping with the heat. Monitor your health. Be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as dizziness, rapid pulse, nausea and confusion. If you or someone you're with experiences these symptoms, move to a cooler place, hydrate and seek medical attention if necessary.

Around 6 p.m. on Friday, firefighters were called out to the McMenamins Grand Lodge at 3505 Pacific Avenue in Forest Grove. Emergency services got several calls reporting a fire in the back of the property in a storage building.

When crews arrived on scene, the storage building was fully engulfed in flames.

The fire was extinguished around 15 minutes later, though firefighters spent an hour working on hot spots.

No one was injured during the fire. When the fire was noticed, Grand Lodge employees evacuated the hotel and restaurant guests out of the main building as a precaution.

There were initial reports that chickens were in the building, but the coop was a safe distance away from the fire outside of the building.

"'A Flood Watch is in effect for areas west of the Cascades through late Wednesday night.

Example video title will go here for this video

PORTLAND, Ore. — A Flood Watch is in effect for most of western Oregon and Washington due to an atmospheric river that is expected to bring heavy rainfall to much of the region.

The Flood Watch will remain in effect through late Wednesday night.

The National Weather Service said flooding is possible Tuesday through Wednesday due to another round of heavy rain Monday night and Tuesday.

""PDX has picked up nearly 2.5 inches of rain since Thursday night, and it's possible we pick up another 2 to 2.5 inches by Wednesday night,"" said KGW Meteorologist Chris McGinness. ""With recent snow, and now very high snow levels over 8,000 feet, melting snow and additional heavy rain are a concern for smaller rivers and tributaries.""

Where could we see flooding?

All locations at risk of flooding are west of the Cascades. The National Weather Service posted a chart showing the flood chances at several area rivers. The National Weather Service tracks 203 gauges around the area.

What are the possible impacts?

Flooding is possible along some rivers and creeks as well as flood-prone roads and trails, the National Weather Service said. Snowmelt will also add runoff for rivers in the Cascades.

On Monday, a spokesperson for Portland Fire and Rescue urged people to stay away from local rivers over the next few days.

The Portland Bureau of Transportation said workers cleared storm drains around the city during the weekend. With rain also bringing risks of landslides, crews on Monday were checking locations in the West Hills for potential landslides to see if ""there's anything that could warrant some preventive maintenance.""

What's an atmospheric river?

Atmospheric river is a newer name for a weather pattern in the Pacific Northwest also known as the Pineapple Express. They are long, narrow regions in the atmosphere that transport moist air from the tropics to higher latitudes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The plumes of precipitable moisture are often formed in areas just north of Hawaii and channel directly into the Pacific Northwest. They often release water vapor in the form of heavy rainfall and high snow levels. Atmospheric rivers can result in flash flooding and mudslides.

Forgive the rare Canadian egotism but I'm sure you're thinking ahead of the draw: where is the Canadian national team?! After a seismic rise through 2022 World Cup qualifying that saw Canada top CONCACAF and go to their first World Cup since 1986, it's been tough sledding for Alphonso Davies and co. They have not had a convincing win against a high-end opponent since qualifying. The coach who steered them to the World Cup, John Herdman, migrated to club soccer. They crashed out of both the Nations League and the Gold Cup in unconvincing style and the ugliest blow came last month when they capitulated in the second half against Jamaica in Copa America qualifiers.

A 4-4 aggregate result, with Canada losing on away goals, means Canada didn't automatically qualify for Copa America and will now have to win a one-game playoff against Trinidad and Tobago in March to reach the tournament.

The entire program is going to have their eyes on the draw, but people will be doing so with a lot less confidence than a year or so ago. Canada has looked disjointed in nearly every performance, has struggled in the back and seems to be ignoring the pressing need for squad turnover. It would be a shame for the likes of Davies, Jonathan David, Tajon Buchanan and Stephen Eustaquio to miss out on Copa America as they remain stars in the region. And they desperately need high-level opponents to play against before co-hosting World Cup games in less than three years.'",sports,soccer
"'High wind warning in effect: midnight tonight to noon Monday.

Coastal flood warning in effect: 11 p.m. tonight to 6 p.m. Monday.

Flooding along Peconic River at Monday afternoon high tide (4 p.m).

Riverhead Police: Move all vehicles from flood-prone parking lots.

A major coastal storm is forecast to bear down on the New York metro region late tonight into Monday, bringing potentially heavy rainfall, high winds and widespread minor to moderate coastal flooding across the area, according to the National Weather Service.

High wind and coastal flood warnings have been issued for eastern Suffolk County, from late tonight through Monday.

Southeast winds of 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph are expected, the weather service said. The strongest winds are expected to occur after 2 a.m. Monday, according to the forecast.

A high wind warning is in effect from midnight tonight to noon on Monday.

Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches is expected, with local amounts of 4 inches possible, according to the NWS forecast.

Widespread moderate flooding is likely, and locally major flooding possible, with the Monday afternoon high tide, the weather service said. Coastal flooding with 1 ½ to 2 ½ feet of inundation above ground level is expected at the Monday afternoon high tide cycle, at about 4 p.m. Monday on the Peconic River in downtown Riverhead, the weather service said in a statement. The tide will be about 3 ½ to 4 feet above normal.

The parking lot along the Peconic River will likely flood tomorrow afternoon during high tide, Riverhead Police said in an advisory this morning. Police urge residents to move their vehicles out of the parking lot to higher ground north of Main Street.

A coastal flood warning is in effect from 11 p.m. tonight until 6 p.m. Monday.

Breaking surf of 12 to 16 feet, causing widespread dune erosion and scattered overwashes, are likely for the ocean beachfront along the south shore.

Storm conditions are likely on all waters Sunday night through Monday, the weather service said.

Temperatures will remain unseasonably warm today and tomorrow, with a high today of 56ºF and Monday’s high reaching about 60ºF.

The precise track of the storm remains uncertain as of Sunday morning, forecasters at the National Weather Service in Upton said in a forecast discussion statement issued early this morning.

“Models are still trying to resolve where the center of this storm will be by the time it gets near us,” the National Weather Service in Upton said in The forecast models are “depicting a broad storm center with two separate circulations,” according to the statement. “There’s at least agreement that the northern circulation will likely pass through the western half of the forecast area Monday morning, with the southern circulation moving through the eastern half of the forecast area Monday afternoon as it tries to merge with the other. This will maintain the likelihood of rain into Monday afternoon for most spots.”

In a statement issued Saturday, PSEG Long Island reminded all residents to assume all downed wires are live. “Please stay as far away as possible from them, and do not drive over or stand near them,” the utility said.

To report a downed wire, call PSEG Long Island’s 24-hour electric service number at 800-490-0075 or call 911.

The assault rifle, a curse by any other name

To the propagandists likening the assault rifle to some innocuous little gun that shoots puny rounds, I suggest they google the Nov. 16 article in the Washington Post entitled Terror On Repeat, a piece meant to alert us to the destructive effects of this weapon. It is meant to disturb and takes one’s breath away. Look up also the May 31, 2022 NPR interview with Uvalde Coroner whose life changed forever after viewing the carnage he was obligated to investigate. Read The Intercept article on May 26, 2022 describing how AR’s are designed to explode human bodies, and the March 20, 2023 Texas Tribune story about the fear Uvalde responding officers felt knowing the shooter had a “battle rifle”. If still able to stomach it, read other stories about having to identify bodies by little backpacks, sneakers, or DNA.

Assault rifle supporters and all of us who tolerate this American tragedy, should be ashamed and sickened. If not, you and we are in a different place in this country.

Penalize ostentatious NFL showboating

As a fan I admit that this is my own personal peeve but I suspect I’m not alone. It used to be when a NFL player did something exceptional, a touchdown, pass interception, quarterback sack, etc. he got a pat on the butt from a teammate and that was sufficient praise. Today he immediately goes into a choreographed dance in front of the cameras, alone or with his teammates as fans and TV viewers are subjected to a display of narcissistic showboating. In college ball showboating is an automatic 15-yard penalty while the NFL allows and encourages it as entertainment. Like college ball, the NFL should impose a stiff penalty for these displays, nullifying the touchdown or interception for instance. Vince Lombardy, the legendary Green Bay Packers coach, always told his players their job is to play football and to just do their job. I’m tired of watching this self-aggrandizing narcissistic showboating. If I want to see choreographed dancing, I’ll watch the Rockettes.

Thanksgiving was something

Looking forward to Easter

It’s been a dry heat

Bring on a Nor’easter

It’s the season in Sonora

So sit on your keister

And forget about summer

That hot stretch was a bummer

Lights are a flicker

Amazing the kiddies

Looks like the whole neighborhood

Must have been busy

Shuffling feet singing all jazzy

Moving about in the nighttime tizzy

Leg of lamb waiting with all the relations

NFL blaring on all of the stations

Oh Winterhaven

The sleigh rides

Loaded with children

Oh Winterhaven

Choirs done rehearsing

With song o’erflowing

Planes have all landed

Its Tucson in winter

It will not be snowing

Hearts do swell in any weather

Trump and Ukraine

Recent letter writers have implied that because Putin did not invade Ukraine during Trump’s time in office that Putin was afraid of Trump’ presidency. I believe the facts lead to a different conclusion.

The Russians bailed Trump out of one of his bankruptcies and helped him get elected. Putin believed he could be counted on to help with the invasion of Ukraine. Remember that Trump met with Putin with only Putin’s translator present. This is probably when Putin requested Trump’s help.

As Trump’s term came to an end he prepared a dossier containing military secrets involving NATO and other issues relevant to an invasion of Ukraine. This dossier has now disappeared. I bet it, or at least a copy, is in the Kremlin. It is more reasonable to believe that Trump aided the invasion of Ukraine rather than inhibited it.

Simplistic history of the US

There are two basic guiding documents in the US. The Declaration of Independence we cannot change and the Constitution which we may. There are two major political parties Democrats and Republicans, each supporting the same two things (hopefully); social justice and fiscal responsibility. Abandon either of these and there is no peace. The Declaration of Independence is aspirational, appealing to our “better angels” and the Constitution is legalistic, appealing to property ownership. The task left by the Founding Fathers is balancing these two equally valid concerns. Go too far to one we are broke; too far to the other and we are slaves. Courts may help, but none has the Solomonic wisdom our circumstances will always need. We citizen-voters must each look into ourselves and ask our individual gods to guide as we face the coming maelstrom of another election year. May you be guided wisely for our children’s sake.

Who’s a fraud?

Re: the Dec. 26 letter “Poll shows fraudulent mail-in ballots.”

It was declared that there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election that cost Trump re-election. As the letter writer enumerated, declaring massive fraud that upended the results was false.

The writer quotes answers to questions from pollsters about attempted fraud, with no empirical data regarding successful fraud.

There were people charged with voting fraud in the 2020 election. Among them were Mark Meadows, who was charged with falsifying his residential address as a storage shed in a district where he did not reside.

Another one was Barry Morphew, who was charged with, and plead guilty to, using his murdered wife’s ballot to vote for Trump.

Perhaps MAGAs firmly believe in false conspiracies because they engage in voting fraud and then inflate the occurrences and project those voluminous misdeeds onto Democrats!

Year in review (sayings to live by)

There are a few sayings that make so much sense, but seem to never catch on. Maybe they will this coming year.

“It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you in to trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” — Mark Twain

“It’s easier to fool some than to convince them they’ve been fooled.” — Anonymous, though attributed to Mark Twain

“Religion is considered by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by rulers as useful” — Seneca the Younger

“I would rather be a devil in alliance with truth, than an angel in alliance with falsehood.” — Ludwig Feuerbach

I am hopeful that problems can be solved logically in the coming year, but the past year’s results don’t seem to bode well for this coming year.

Finally, “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one learned in school.” — Albert Einstein

Don’t say gay

Dear Editor,

I would like to point out to all those people who think that being exposed to books or other media (drag shows, etc.) with LGBT content influences impressionable young people to “turn” gay — it doesn’t work that way.

Everyone I know, myself included, “turned” gay without any outside influences. We knew we were different, and made every attempt to hide it. There was no one encouraging us — just the opposite. If homosexuality was ever mentioned it was in a very negative context. Yet most of us eventually felt compelled to stop hiding who we were, from ourselves and others.

You can ban books and drag shows, but that won’t stop people from loving whom they love. So give it up.

Abortion is indeed healthcare

Re: the Dec. 27 letter “Abortion is not curing a ‘disease’.”

A letter to the editor in the Star claims that abortion is murder and is not healthcare, as it does not treat a disease. His silly semantic argument is full of holes. Normal labor and delivery is also not the treatment of a disease, but of course is universally considered needed healthcare. There are multiple other examples of healthcare that do not involve disease treatment (well baby checks to screening colonoscopies for example).

Whatever one’s opinion on abortion is, let that be your personal choice and do not impose your stance on anyone else. Their individual circumstance might be such that an abortion is a medical necessity. Multiple recent cases in the news point to the fact that there are many instances when complex, subtle, and time sensitive medical decisions have to be made. Politicians can not possible write laws to foresee all those circumstances so please let physicians and families make these decisions without interference from people with rigid opinions like the letter writer.

"'MIKE FEDERICO FROM COLLIERVILLE, TN: I was reading an article that made me hopeful that Pat Freiermuth may play this week. The article mentioned that the Steelers have until 4 p.m. on the Saturday before the game to activate him. Are there practice/participation restrictions on a player who is on injured reserve? Are the official restrictions related just to game participation?

ANSWER: Players on the injured reserve list are not permitted to practice with the team. That's why teams are allowed to designate a player to return from injured reserve, which then opens a 21-day window where the player can return to practice and help the team to decide if the player can return to the 53-man roster or needs to stay on injured reserve for the remainder of the season. On Wednesday, Nov. 15 the Steelers designated Pat Freiermuth to return from IR, and he began practicing with the team that day. Starting Nov. 15, the Steelers have 21 days to activate Freiermuth to the active roster or leave him on injured reserve for the rest of the season.

BRAD McGILL FROM GROVE CITY, PA: As we dedicated fans cheer on the quest for a seventh Super Bowl win, am I correct in thinking the Steelers were the first to win 4, 5 and 6 Super Bowls before others followed?

ANSWER: The Steelers were the first franchise to win 3 Super Bowls (by defeating Dallas in Super Bowl XIII); and the first to win 4 Super Bowls (by defeating the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV). San Francisco became the first franchise to win 5 Super Bowls (by defeating San Diego in Super Bowl XXIX), and Dallas matched the feat of 5 by defeating the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX. The Steelers were the first franchise to win 6 Super Bowls (by defeating Arizona in Super Bowl XLIII), and since then New England has matched the feat of 6 (by defeating the Rams in Super Bowl LIII).

MIKE CALLENDER MOORESVILLE, IN: How long is Kwon Alexander's contract with the Steelers? I'd like to see him back next year.

ANSWER: On July 30, Kwon Alexander signed a 1 year, $1,317,500 contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, including a $152,500 signing bonus and a salary of $1,317,500. He is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent in March 2024.

STEFAN PISOCKI FROM WILMINGTON, DE: The talk of Hines Ward's chances of getting into the Pro Football Hall of Fame got me thinking about what effect winning the Super Bowl MVP Award would have on a player's chances. For the Steelers, Franco Harris, Terry Bradshaw, and Lynn Swann all were voted Super Bowl MVPs and are in the Hall of Fame. Ward is not in, and Santonio Holmes has no chance, in my opinion. So this small sample suggests that more than 50 percent of Super Bowl MVPs wind up in the Hall of Fame. Does this hold true league-wide?

ANSWER: The actual number is way more than 50 percent, because there are 4 former Super Bowl MVPs who still are active players – Patrick Mahomes, Cooper Kupp, Von Miller, and Aaron Rodgers – and there are 7 others who are not yet eligible because they haven't been retired for the required five years – Tom Brady, Eli Manning, Drew Brees, Joe Flacco, Malcolm Smith, Nick Foles, and Julian Edelman. Here is the complete list of former Super Bowl MVPs who are eligible to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame but are not: Harvey Martin, Jim Plunkett, Phil Simms, Doug Williams, Ottis Anderson, Mark Rypien, Larry Brown, Desmond Howard, Dexter Jackson, Deion Branch, Hines Ward, and Santonio Holmes.

"'WNBA superstar A’ja Wilson is a huge fan of South Carolina point guard Raven Johnson’s current game, and she thinks Caitlin Clark may have something to do with that.

"'A first-of-its-kind study reveals that damaged mitochondrial DNA sets off a chain reaction that can spread Parkinson's disease to other parts of the brain in a similar way to an infection.

Mitochondria – tiny organelles in our cells that produce energy – contain a DNA bank of their very own, separate from the chromosomes in the cell's nucleus.

Damaged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can activate two proteins involved in the immune system, and researchers found these specific proteins are upregulated in the brains of both humans with Parkinson's disease and mice engineered to model the condition.

The researchers also identified another protein – that plays a key role in spreading damaged mitochondrial DNA to other neurons – which may be a new target for developing treatments to prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease.

The team from Denmark and Germany thinks that blood tests could detect damaged mitochondrial DNA, as early biomarkers for Parkinson's disease.

""For the first time, we can show that mitochondria, the vital energy producers within brain cells, particularly neurons, undergo damage, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial DNA,"" says biotechnologist Shohreh Issazadeh-Navikas from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

""This initiates and spreads the disease like a wildfire through the brain.""

In the past, researchers focussed on searching for hereditary factors to explain cases of Parkinson's among family members. Over time it became clear that these factors couldn't explain the majority of patient conditions.

""Our findings establish that the spread of the damaged genetic material, the mitochondrial DNA,"" Issazadeh-Navikas says, ""causes the symptoms reminiscent of Parkinson's disease and its progression to dementia.""

The researchers studied postmortem brain samples from people with and without Parkinson's symptoms in order to pinpoint molecular pathways involved in the pathology of the disease.

They found that two proteins, TLR9 and TLR4, are activated in the spread of damaged mtDNA, and these proteins are upregulated in Parkinson's disease patients.

The researchers then used a mouse model of Parkinson's disease with induced mutations in genes that control these pathways, to study the role of mtDNA damage.

These mice had activation of TLR9 and TLR4 signaling in the identified molecular pathways found in humans, and damaged mtDNA that was expelled from neurons. This could then spread to other neurons and cause neurotoxicity.

Parkinson's disease dementia-like behavioral symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric, motor, and cognitive impairments, were also induced in healthy mice when they injected damaged mtDNA into their brains.

""Small fragments of – actually DNA – from the mitochondria are released into the cell,"" explains Issazadeh-Navikas. ""When these fragments of damaged DNA are misplaced, they become toxic to the cell, prompting nerve cells to expel this toxic mitochondrial DNA.""

Neuron damage in healthy mice happened in areas far from the injection site, too. It appears the damaged mtDNA causes the spread of Parkinson's disease dementia traits in a way that is similar to how viruses spread.

With further analysis, the researchers discovered that a protein known as Rps3 helps TLR4 to recognize damaged mtDNA and helps expel toxic fragments from neurons.

""Given the interconnected nature of brain cells, these toxic DNA fragments spread to neighboring and distant cells, similar to an uncontrolled forest fire sparked by a casual bonfire,"" Issazadeh-Navikas says.

""It could be possible that the damage of the mitochondrial DNA in the brain cells leaks from the brain into the blood.""

The team's ongoing research aims to investigate mitochondrial DNA damage detection in the blood as a predictor of disease progression in the hope of bringing us one step closer to understanding how Parkinson's develops in the brain and progresses into dementia.

""These insights may pave the way for innovative treatment strategies and monitoring approaches for Parkinson's disease,"" the authors write.

The study has been published in Molecular Psychiatry.'",climate,forest fire
"'If you’re a sports fan and also happen to subscribe to Apple News+, today is a good day! However, today is also a weird day for anyone who knows that The Athletic is owned by The New York Times. It’s complicated.

Today, Apple announced in a press release that The Athletic — owned by The New York Times — has joined Apple News Plus, providing sports fans with one of the most popular sports journalism websites in the world. Now, instead of subscribing to The Athletic directly, fans can get access to the publication as part of their Apple News+ or Apple One Premier subscription.

Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, seems to be behind the addition. Cue is a huge sports fan and has really helped drive sports content and deals through Apple over the years, so it’s no surprise to see him say he is a “devoted reader” of the publication.

“Like so many lifelong sports fans, I am a devoted reader of The Athletic and their fantastic sports reporting and local coverage. We’re so proud to now bring sports fans The Athletic in Apple News+ — which millions of News+ subscribers are going to love.”

David Perpich, publisher of The Athletic, said in a statement that the publication is “thrilled” to “introduce even more readers to the best-in-class journalism that only The Athletic can produce.”

“The Athletic is home to award-winning, deeply reported coverage of teams, leagues, and players for devoted fans around the world. We provide subscribers with every sports story that matters, brought to life by the most talented newsroom in the business. We’re thrilled to work with Apple News to introduce even more readers to the best-in-class journalism that only The Athletic can produce.”

The company says that The Athletic is made up of a newsroom of more than 450 full-time writers, editors, and producers covering the English Premier League, NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLS, PGA, National Women’s Soccer League, NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, NCAA men’s college basketball, NCAA women’s college basketball, LaLiga, UEFA Champions League, and more. It will be available to Apple News+ subscribers in the U.S., the U.K., Canada, and Australia.

Apple News+ is available for $12.99 per month as a standalone service and is also included in Apple One Premier — Apple’s subscription bundle service — for $37.95 per month. Apple One Premier includes all of Apple’s subscription services, including Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Arcade, and iCloud+.

Oh, and The Athletic isn’t the only publication coming to Apple News. Almost as a footnote, Apple announced that Wirecutter (also owned by The New York Times) is also coming to the Apple News app. The company says that its coverage will start appearing on the app “early next year.”

One thing to note about The Athletic coming to Apple News Plus and Wirecutter coming to Apple News is that it does not mean that its owner, The New York Times, is returning to the platform. In 2020, The New York Times announced it was leaving Apple News Plus and the Apple News app altogether. There is still no word if the company plans to return to the app in any way. Perhaps experimenting with The Athletic is a way to test the waters again? We’ll see.'",sports,soccer

"'College Station has had a couple strikes in getting a public baseball complex in the city, but citizens came out Wednesday to voice their opinions on why the effort is still needed.

The College Station City Council hosted a public meeting to ask the community whether or not more baseball fields are needed and, if so, what age ranges they should serve. This meeting was requested during an August council meeting when the Texas Independence Ballpark project was discontinued due to soil issues. That complex was to be owned and operated by the city and available for Little League games and practices and baseball and softball tournaments.

Many citizens voiced their support for more baseball fields, including 10-year-old Madelyn Schmidt, who plays on the College Station Little League and BV Scrappers 11u team and prepared a presentation to the city about the need for more ballpark fields.

“I’m here as one voice over 800 Little League players here in College Station,” she said. “I want to share with you that, coming from the point of view as a baseball player, there are not enough fields to accommodate the growing numbers of Little League and traveling baseball players.”

Due to the lack of baseball fields in College Station, Schmidt said she often has to travel to attend practices.

“I have to travel to Bryan to attend travel baseball practice,” she said. “For my age groups, there are only seven fields that are available in College Station.”

Schmidt said she wants College Station to understand the need for more baseball fields in the community to allow her an opportunity to play locally before she ages out.

“The question should not be ‘Does there need to be more baseball fields?’ It should be ‘What can we do to make sure that we have enough space to allow anyone that wants to play baseball an opportunity,?” she said.

Kevin Hodge is the CEO of Texas Twelve, a baseball program that works with players aged 8 to 18, and said he wants to see more fields available due to the benefit baseball brings youngsters.

“We typically send anywhere from 50 to 80 players to college out of our program each year,” he said. “Just this last year, we had two players drafted in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft.”

Hodge said all College Station fields are either 200 or 300 feet long, which cannot accommodate older baseball players, leaving local players to travel outside of the city to find fields to play on.

“In College Station, we have nine fields. Six of those were built in 1982,” he said. “There are currently zero fields for play in College Station for players ages 14 and up.”

A baseball facility would serve the community in multiple ways, Hodge said, including benefiting the local economy.

“I want it to be clear there’s definitely a need,” he said. “[A facility] would be great for both our players and our community. You now have people spending money in hotels and restaurants instead of other places.”

Dell Billings also came out to speak on the need for baseball fields due to having a preteen son who plays on a local traveling team.

“We don’t have adequate time on the fields in College Station to practice,” he said. “Tonight, we’ll be practicing in Bryan. That means a further drive and getting to bed later.”

Billings said availability is a big issue.

“There’s a big demand for those fields,” he said. “People don’t understand that. When they go on Highway 6, they see fields at Central Park or Veterans Park, but those fields are not always available to the College Station Little League.”

Baseball season takes place in the spring, which Billings said is off-time for Bryan and College Station due to the lack of Aggie football, meaning more baseball fields could bring economic advantages as well.

“It would be a great time for revenue for hotels and the city, having people from other cities come here and enjoy the fields,” he said. “There’s a demand for baseball tournaments on the weekends.”

Billings said Little League baseball has helped his family and others create new connections, bringing plenty of benefits to the children and adults who participate.

“Our kid’s best friend is a player he met in Little League,” he said. “Baseball for our kids is a sense of community and we want that to grow in the city.”'",sports,baseball
"'Whether you were spot-on or wildly off-base, The Masked Singer reveals for Season 10 have not disappointed, and we have the details for each Masked Singer Season 10 cast member revealed so far. (We’re still not over Diver’s identity.)

The Masked Singer—also abbreviated as TMS—is Fox’s reality TV singing competition series, in which celebrities compete against each other in performances while wearing head-to-toe costumes and face masks to conceal their identities. Throughout the season, a panel of judges guess the celebrities’ identities based on their voices and clues provided before and after each performance. Each week, the contestant with the least amount of votes from the studio audience is eliminated and takes off their masks to reveal their identities.

More from StyleCaster

The series, which premiered in 2019, is based on South Korea’s King of the Mask Singer, which follows a similar format. Since the premiere of The King of the Mask Singer in 2015, The Masked Singer has expanded to dozens of countries across the world including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.

“It was flypaper TV right from the get-go,” The Masked Singer executive producer Craig Plestis told The Hollywood Reporter in 2019 about why he wanted to produce the show in the United States. “I just knew right away this was a special show. It was unbelievable in its appeal — and the game play, spectacle, family-viewing…[and] it was this huge hit in Asia…. If we do the job here, it should work here.”

Plestis also explained how he convinced Fox to greenlight The Masked Singer for a first season. “From the get-go, Fox asked how we were going to cast this. They were firm in saying, ‘We’re not going to do the show unless you get unbelievable talent for the show,’” he said. “It has to be recognizable names. When the masks come off, everyone has to recognize that face — or they have to have some huge credibility, either in sports, in entertainment, TV, film, music. Some people were easy to cast. They saw the potential of the show.”

He continued, “They loved the idea of being behind a mask and no one knowing who they were, and showing off the talent that no one knew that they even had. They got it right away. Some people said no. In the end, we got great names, and all of them are big in their field in one way or another. The stats that we have, between the Grammy winners [and other achievements], is really phenomenal. When we started putting together and looked at all the awards all these people have won, we realized we just don’t have one or two great people; we have 12 great people.”

Once one pair of panties hits the stage, others follow,” he said. When asked if he considered creating a lingerie line, Ginuwine responded, “I’d really like to do that. It would be unusual, something different.”

Despite the attention, Husky was “totally loyal — a family dog” (Week 4)

Ginuwine started dating his wife, Tonya M. Johnston, also known as Sole, in 1999. They married in 2003 and welcomed two daughters: Story, born in 2002; and Dream, born in 2002.

"'Monday marks 150 days from the NFL Draft coming to Detroit, and officials honored the occasion by celebrating the milestone and providing an update on planning.

Officials from around the city and state gathered at Ford Field to announce hospitality and community initiatives around the draft, which takes place April 25-27, 2024, in Downtown Detroit.

Related: Register now for temporary, paid positions supporting the NFL Draft Experience in Detroit

The draft will take place in the areas around Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza, but specific details are still being finalized by the NFL and the local coalition.

According to officials, the NFL Draft Experience – the NFL's interactive football theme park – will also be open for all three days of the draft. Fans will have the chance to play games, check out interactive exhibits, autograph sessions and take pictures with the Vince Lombardi Trophy.

Community events related to the draft in Detroit will be free for everyone, the officials announced.

“The 2024 NFL Draft will highlight all that makes Detroit and Southeast Michigan a great place to live, work, invest, and visit,” Visit Detroit President and CEO Claude Molinari, who is also the organizing co-chair for the draft, said in a statement. “Visit Detroit is proud to partner with Detroit Metropolitan Airport, local hotels, restaurants, and shops to create a best-in-class hospitality experience for visitors from touchdown to takeoff.”

The coalition said it has done research, held discussions and listening sessions to identify community priorities, and literacy non-profit Beyond Basic and Project Play, an initiative of the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan, were selected as the inaugural non-profit partners. A $1 million donation was announced to the group.

The initiative is a first-of-its-kind and the living legacy program will be carried forward by the Detroit Sports Commission past the NFL Draft and through the 2027 NCAA Men's Final Four at Ford Field.

“This unprecedented legacy program will allow us to build on the momentum from the 2024 Draft and continue to support important causes that impact Detroit youth,” said Detroit Sports Commission Executive Director Dave Beachnau. “The Detroit Sports Commission commits to including a community legacy component to all major sporting events coming to Detroit and ensuring that every event has a positive impact on our community.”

“The draft is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to showcase the amazing transformation and revitalization that has taken place in Detroit, while also significantly benefiting local businesses and residents,” said Bill Emerson, the president of Rocket Companies. ""We look forward to showcasing both the amazing people and businesses in our community while continuing to work hand-in-hand with them, local government and philanthropic partners to ensure this is an event that everyone can enjoy.”

Detroit Experience Initiative

Along with the draft, Visit Detroit and the City of Detroit are working with partners on the Detroit Experience Initiative.

It's a neighborhood engagement program that will feature pre-draft events held at City of Detroit Parks & Recreation facilities that will bring fun and excitement to residents across all seven districts of the city.

""We are so thrilled to connect the NFL Draft to our city center,” Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a statement. “Detroit’s NFL Draft is going to be fully integrated into our downtown and have activities in our neighborhoods. ""It certainly will be a fun and memorable event for thousands of football fans that will showcase the great progress our city has been making.""

The city's Civil Rights, Inclusion & Opportunity Department is also working with other organizations to prepare and certify local businesses so they are ready for the opportunities created by the NFL Draft.

“Our local coalition of stakeholders and partners are working hard to ensure that whether you live in Detroit or are visiting Detroit, the 2024 NFL Draft is an exciting, inclusive, fun-filled experience,” said organizing co-chair and Founder of Moment Strategies Alexis Wiley. “Through our legacy commitment, the 2024 NFL Draft’s impact will be felt in our region for years to come.”

Work with the NFL Draft

Officials also said there will be temporary paid positions supporting the NFL Draft Experience. Fans and residents can learn more about NFL Teammate opportunities and register for positions at visitdetroit.com/teammate-opportunity. Teammates help promote a fun and inclusive environment of fan engagement by fulfilling a variety of team roles throughout the NFL Draft footprint.

"'The forecast for Halloween 2023. CBS News Miami

MIAMI -- It will be warm Tuesday for those planning to go trick-or-treating and some in South Florida may have to dodge a stray shower.

""We're going to be wickedly warm for your Halloween,"" CBS News Miami meteorologist Lissette Gonzalez said. ""And especially spooky with lows in the 80s.""

The high temperatures are expected to be in near-record temperature and humidity levels will also be high, Gonzalez said.

""It will be hauntigly humid,"" she said. ""So it will feel warmer than the actual temperatures.""

The high temperature is expected to top out in the upper 80s before falling back to the upper 70s.

There is a 20 percent chance of a stray shower during the evening, according to Gonzalez.

An approaching front is expected to bring drier air to the region for the back half of the week, Gonzalez said.

A coastal flood advisory remains in effect due for South Florida because of the potential for saltwater coastal flooding around high tide times.

"'Tighter water restrictions for drought-stricken northeast Spain went into effect Wednesday, when authorities in Catalonia said that Barcelona may need to have fresh water shipped in by boat in the coming months.

Catalonia is suffering its worst drought on record with reservoirs that provide water for about 6 million people, including Spain’s second-biggest city Barcelona, filled to just 18% of their capacity. By comparison, Spain’s reservoirs as a whole are at 43% of their capacity.

Spanish authorities and experts point to the impact of climate change in the increasingly hot and dry weather behind the extended drought in Catalonia.

Barcelona has already been relying on Europe’s largest desalination plant for drinking water, and a sewage treatment and purification plant to make up for the drop in water from wells and rivers.

Catalonia officially entered the “pre-emergency” phase for drought, which lowers the daily use per person from 230 to 210 liters (60 to 55 gallons) of water per day. That includes personal use as well as what town halls use per inhabitant for services. Catalonia’s water agency says that the average person in Catalonia consumes on average 116 liters (30 gallons) per day for domestic use.

Municipal governments are now prohibited from using drinking water for street cleaning or to water lawns. Water limits for use in industry and agriculture have been increased.

If water reserves fall below 16% capacity, then Catalonia would enter into a full-blown drought “emergency” whereby water would be limited to 200 liters (52 gallons) per person, and then potentially dropped down to 160 liters (42 gallons) per person, and all irrigation in agriculture would require previous approval.

Authorities have warned that the drought “emergency” could just be weeks away, unless it rains — a lot.

If not, then Barcelona could need tankers to bring in drinking water. In 2008, that extremely expensive measure was used to keep the city supplied during a drought.

“Unfortunately, we have to be prepared for every scenario, and we are close to needing boats to bring in water if the situation that we have seen over the past months continues,” Catalonia regional president Pere Aragonès said during a trip to South Korea on Wednesday.

Aragonès said that his administration was working with Spain’s ministry for the ecological transition to prepare for the eventuality of the water tankers. He added that his administration would prefer to bring in water for southern Catalonia where the Ebro River meets the Mediterranean Sea.

"'The summer of 2023 has been very significant for the travel industry. By the end of July, international tourist arrivals globally reached 84% of pre-pandemic levels. In some European countries, such as France, Denmark and Ireland, tourism demand even surpassed its pre-pandemic level.

This may be great news economically, but there’s concern that a return to the status quo is already showing dire environmental and social consequences.

The summer saw record-breaking heatwaves across many parts of the world. People were forced to flee wildfires in Greece and Hawaii, and extreme weather warnings were issued in many popular holiday destinations like Portugal, Spain and Turkey. Experts attributed these extreme conditions to climate change.

Read more: European heatwave: what’s causing it and is climate change to blame?

Tourism is part of the problem. The tourism sector generates around one-tenth of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis.

The negative impacts of tourism on the environment have become so severe that some are suggesting drastic changes to our travel habits are inevitable. In a report from 2023 that analysed the future of sustainable travel, tour operator Intrepid Travel proposed that “carbon passports” will soon become a reality if the tourism industry hopes to survive.

What is a carbon passport?

The idea of a carbon passport centres on each traveller being assigned a yearly carbon allowance that they cannot exceed. These allowances can then “ration” travel.

This concept may seem extreme. But the idea of personal carbon allowances is not new. A similar concept (called “personal carbon trading”) was discussed in the House of Commons in 2008, before being shut down due to its perceived complexity and the possibility of public resistance.

The average annual carbon footprint for a person in the US is 16 tonnes – one of the highest rates in the world. In the UK this figure sits at 11.7 tonnes, still more than five times the figure recommended by the Paris Agreement to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C.

Story continues

Globally, the average annual carbon footprint of a person is closer to 4 tonnes. But, to have the best chance of preventing temperature rise from overshooting 2°C, the average global carbon footprint needs to drop to under 2 tonnes by 2050. This figure equates to around two return flights between London and New York.

Intrepid Travel’s report predicts that we will see carbon passports in action by 2040. However, several laws and restrictions have been put in place over the past year that suggest our travel habits may already be on the verge of change.

Targeting air travel

Between 2013 and 2018, the amount of CO₂ emitted by commercial aircrafts worldwide increased by 32%. Improvements in fuel efficiency are slowly reducing per passenger emissions. But research from 2014 found that whatever the industry’s efforts to reduce its carbon emissions, they will be outweighed by the growth in air traffic.

For emission reductions to have any meaningful effect, ticket prices would have to rise by 1.4% each year, discouraging some people from flying. However, in reality, ticket prices are falling.

Some European countries are beginning to take measures to reduce air travel. As of April 1 2023, passengers on short-haul flights and older aircraft in Belgium have been subject to increased taxes to encourage alternative forms of travel.

Less than two months later France banned short-haul domestic flights where the same trip can be made by train in two-and-a-half hours or less. Spain is expected to follow suit.

A similar scheme could also be on the horizon for Germany. In 2021, a YouGov poll found that 70% of Germans would support such measures to fight climate change if alternative transport routes like trains or ships were available.

Cruises and carbon

It’s not just air travel that’s being criticised. An investigation by the European Federation for Transport and Environment in 2023 found that cruise ships pump four times as many sulphuric gases (which are proven to cause acid rain and several respiratory conditions) into the atmosphere than all of Europe’s 291 million cars combined.

Statistics like these have forced European destinations to take action against the cruise industry. In July, Amsterdam’s council banned cruise ships from docking in the city centre in a bid to reduce tourism and pollution – an initiative that has shown success elsewhere.

In 2019 Venice was the most polluted European port, due to large numbers of cruise ship visits. But it dropped to 41st place in 2022 after a ban on large cruise ships entering the city’s waters reduced air pollutants from ships in Venice by 80%.

Changing destinations

Intrepid Travel’s report also highlights that not only how we travel, but where we travel will soon be impacted by climate change. Boiling temperatures will probably diminish the allure of traditional beach destinations, prompting European tourists to search for cooler destinations such as Belgium, Slovenia and Poland for their summer holidays.

Several travel agencies reported seeing noticeable increases in holiday bookings to cooler European destinations like Scandinavia, Ireland and the UK during 2023’s peak summer travel months.

Whatever the solution may be, changes to our travel habits look inevitable. Destinations across the globe, from Barcelona to the Italian riveria and even Mount Everest are already calling for limits on tourist numbers as they struggle to cope with crowds and pollution.

Holidaymakers should prepare to change their travel habits now, before this change is forced upon them.

"'Editor’s note: The Tribune-Herald is wrapping up 2023 with a series looking back at the Waco area’s top stories of the year, chosen by our editors and staff writers. The countdown concludes with No. 1.

A few days of massive rain in Central Texas in late October raised a drought-starved Lake Waco by 15 feet and washed away some 15 months of water restrictions in the Waco area.

But it was only a partial and temporary cure for the drought of 2022-23, which one climatologist called the worst on record for Waco and much of Texas, and which persists in some counties in the region.

“The 2011 drought is still the drought of record statewide, but this past summer for College Station, Waco, the Hill Country, Central Texas, and much of the southern part of the state, 2023 had the record,” said William Baule, a research assistant professor and regional climatologist with the Texas A&M University Southern Regional Climate Center, in a Dec. 22 phone interview.

He said temperatures around the world have increased in recent years, driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.

The drought began in January 2022 and deepened that summer. That July, for the first time in living memory, the city imposed Stage 2 water restrictions, limiting irrigation to twice a week. The measures were lifted in November 2023. The experience has led city of Waco water officials to prepare a new drought contingency plan that will be unveiled in coming weeks.

Lake Waco’s main source, the North Bosque River, remained no more than a trickle from summer 2022 through fall 2023.

On Oct. 25, the lake level fell to 450.3 feet above sea level, nearly 12 feet below its normal elevation and its lowest level since the 2003 lake expansion. City officials were considering the possibility of ordering Stage 3 drought restrictions.

That night, the rain began in the North Bosque River watershed. By the next day, the river at Clifton was in flood stage, and within a few days, Lake Waco was 3 feet above normal.

The U.S. Drought Monitor, which gauges drought level using factors such as soil moisture, rainfall, hydrology and vegetation, showed McLennan County was out of drought by mid-November, though “abnormally dry.” At that point, McLennan County had seen 99 weeks of drought since Jan. 1, 2022, much of it “extreme” or “exceptional.”

Parts of McLennan County since then have seen moderate drought, mostly erased by 2.8 inches of rainfall in the days before Christmas, and Lake Waco remained slightly above its normal elevation of 462 feet on Friday. However, neighboring Coryell and Bell counties remain in moderate to severe drought.

Shane McLellan, McLennan County Agrilife extension agent, agrees that the 2023 drought was worse here than the infamous drought of 2011.

To fully recover from the past two years of drought, he said in a Dec. 18 email, McLennan County needs multiple, consistent, slow-soaking rains to replenish deep soil moisture. It also needs a heavy rain event to fill local stock tanks and bodies of water, he said.

A lack of rainfall coupled with extreme heat made the 2023 drought especially punishing. According to records from the National Weather Service for Waco Regional Airport in 2023:

Waco had 66 days with a high of 100 or more, a number beat only by the 90 days in 2011 and 68 days in 2022. It had consecutive 100-degree highs from July 17 to Aug. 14, tying 1998 for fifth-place on that measure.

The mercury hit 110 on Aug. 20 and 25, tying for fifth-place for the hottest temperatures on record.

Waco saw 71 days without measurable precipitation from June 17 to Aug. 26, topped only by the 82-day rainless streak in summer 1924.

Waco is set to close out the year with 29.3 inches of rain, about 6.8 inches below normal but much better than the 20.8 inches recorded in 2022. December has had about 3.1 inches of rain, more than half an inch above normal.

The drought and the unprecedented drop in lake levels have caused city of Waco officials to seriously consider backup water supply plans, such as diverting Brazos River water into the municipal water supply during emergencies. The city has unused water rights in the river dating back more than a century.

“While we were in Stage 2 water restrictions, it was brought up, rerouting water from the Brazos, but that’s quite expensive and it takes a while to make it happen,” city of Waco water spokesperson Jessica Emmett Sellers said in a phone interview last week.

She also pointed out that Waco also has treated effluent that flows into the Brazos and could be recaptured.

“Treated effluent that goes into the Brazos is cleaner than what’s already there,” she said.

The water use restrictions that Waco and its customer cities adopted in 2022 and 2023 are based on the 2019 drought contingency plan, which is in the process of being revised, Sellers said.

She said the city wants to learn from these past two years and encourage residents to use water responsibly all the time.

“We’re considering recommending potentially year-round water restrictions, taking cues from successes, looking at peer cities and trying to adopt good practices,” Sellers said.

City staff will take the plan to the city council in January or February for hearings and approval so that homeowners and gardeners can know what to plan for as they start choosing plants for spring.

“The biggest thing is we’re not fully out of the woods,” Sellers said. “We want to take what we’ve learned and encourage our residents to apply it. Think about drought resistant plants and continue to use water responsibly and not wastefully into the future.”

The long drought continues to take a lingering toll on agriculture and forestry.

A lack of consistent rainfall over the last several years has reduced grass and hay for livestock, McLellan said.

“That low supply of hay drives prices up at a time we need more volume of hay to feed,” he said.

“Frost events, armyworms and lack of moisture have really hurt hay growers and Texas is at an all-time low for ‘stored hay’ since the 1950s,” McLellan said. “The frost, insect damage and timing of rain, and overall lack of rains have been very negative for agriculture the last few years.”

McLellan said trees are still recovering from two years of drought, compounded by hard freezes in February 2021 and December 2022.

He predicted that McLennan County will “continue to have trees lose canopy and die for the next 10 to 12 years from environmental stress events.”

Climate extremes over the past few years have left trees throughout the region more susceptible to disease, said Kiley Moran, spokesperson for Texas A&M Forest Service in McLennan County and surrounding counties.

“It’s important to seal up any wounds from pruning as soon as possible to prevent transmission of a disease,” Moran said.

Grasses are quick to spring back from drought, so the area has seen some good growth over the last couple of months, Moran said.

“Until we get some truly wetting rainfall, we will continue to see a low level drought,” Moran said. “This could translate into an uptick in fires through the winter carried predominantly by fine fuels such as grasses and leaf litter.”

The National Weather Service forecast shows rain chances returning Tuesday.

Baule, the Texas A&M climate scientist, said more rainfall relief may be on the way soon as an El Niño effect in the Pacific Ocean begins to influence weather in Texas.

El Niño means sea surface temperatures in these regions of ocean are more than half a degree Celsius above normal.

“In the coming months we should see the usual effects of El Niño, which are normal to above normal rainfall, and temperatures should be near normal,” Baule said. “El Niño should continue through the spring. Then during the April to June timeframe we should see a neutral Pacific, meaning neither El Niño, nor La Niña.”

The Pacific has seen two consecutive years of La Niña, in which a cooler-than-normal Pacific tends to produce below-normal rainfall and warmer temperatures in Texas, Baule said.'",climate,drought

The three-year drought that has left millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Iran with little water wouldn’t have happened without human-caused climate change, according to a new study on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023. (AP Photo/Anmar Khalil, File)

A three-year drought that has left millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Iran with little water wouldn’t have happened without human-caused climate change, a new study found.

The west Asian drought, which started in July 2020, is mostly because hotter-than-normal temperatures are evaporating the little rainfall that fell, according to a flash study Wednesday by a team of international climate scientists at World Weather Attribution.

Without the world warming 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-19th century, “it would not be a drought at all,” said lead author Friederike Otto, an Imperial College of London climate scientist.

It’s a case of climate change unnaturally intensifying naturally dry conditions into a humanitarian crisis that has left people thirsty, hungry and displaced, concluded the research, which has not yet undergone peer review but follows scientifically valid techniques to look for the fingerprints of global warming.

The team looked at temperatures, rainfall and moisture levels and compared what happened in the last three years to multiple computer simulations of the conditions in a world without human-caused climate change.

“Human-caused global climate change is already making life considerably harder for tens of millions of people in West Asia,” said study co-author Mohammed Rahimi, a professor of climatology at Semnan University in Iran. “With every degree of warming Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harder places to live.”

Computer simulations didn’t find significant climate change fingerprints in the reduced rainfall, which was low but not too rare, Otto said. But evaporation of water in lakes, rivers, wetlands and soil “was much higher than it would have been’’ without climate change-spiked temperatures, she said.

In addition to making near-normal water conditions into an extreme drought, study authors calculated that the drought conditions in Syria and Iraq are 25 times more likely because of climate change, and in Iran, 16 times more likely.

Kelly Smith, assistant director of the U.S. National Drought Mitigation Center in Nebraska, who was not part of the study, said the research made sense.

Drought is not unusual to the Middle East region and conflict, including Syria’s civil war, makes the area even more vulnerable to drought because of degraded infrastructure and weakened water management, said study co-author Rana El Hajj of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in Lebanon.

“This is already touching the limits of what some people are able to adapt to,” Otto said. “As long as we keep burning fossil fuels or even give out new licenses to explore new oil and gas fields these kinds of events will only get worse and keep on destroying livelihoods and keeping food prices high. And this is not just a problem for some parts of the world, but really a problem for everyone.”

"'Advisories will be in effect until 2 a.m. Monday and includes warnings of dangerous swimming and surfing conditions, beach erosion, and minor tidal overflow.

Example video title will go here for this video

SAN DIEGO — A high-surf and a coastal flood advisory will be in effect through Monday at San Diego County beaches, with large breaking waves up to 12 feet and some expected minor flooding, forecasters said.

Advisories

Both advisories will be in effect until 2 a.m. Monday and include warnings of dangerous swimming and surfing conditions, beach erosion and minor tidal overflow during morning high tides at low-lying coastal areas such as beach parking lots and walkways.

On Friday morning, the Coronado Police Department closed the boardwalk behind Hotel Del Coronado at 1500 Orange Avenue for an undetermined amount of time due to high tides. The San Diego Fire Department on Friday also closed Mission Bay Channel due to high surf until Monday, advising boaters the alternate option is San Diego Bay. SDFD added that San Diego lifeguards will be periodically advising boaters on surf conditions via VHF channel 16.

Locations most susceptible to flooding include Cardiff and Seaside State Beaches, portions of Del Mar, La Jolla Shores, Mission Beach and Imperial Beach. Potential flooding of parking lots, parks and roads with isolated road closures can be expected, according to the National Weather Service.

Officials advised that breaking waves can sweep people off jetties and docks and into dangerous seas. Inexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions.

Forecast

AT THE COAST:

Higher surf will continue through the start of the New Year with the possibility of some waves up to 15 feet. A High Surf Warning has been issued for our coastline starting Thursday morning and lasting through early Monday. Dangerously high surf is expected to peak over the weekend with most waves between 8 feet and 12 feet but some sets as high as 15 feet.

To accompany the High Surf Warning, a Coastal Flood Advisory is also in effect with low lying parking lots, boardwalks, and neighborhoods seeing the chance of minor coastal flooding.

Tidal overflow will also be a hazard as the high surf is coupled with morning high tides between 5 to 6 feet.

MORNING TIDE TIMES:

Saturday: 5.3' at 10:14 am

Sunday: 4.9' at 10:51 am

With many people expected to be out and about for New Year's Eve into New Year's Day, our chance of rain is slim, but there is a potential for some scattered showers to come about. No widespread rain is expected, but we can't rule out some light activity either. All models favor, however, mostly dry weather to ring in the new year.

"'Stanford mayor issues State of Emergency amid water shortage

STANFORD, Ky. (WTVQ) — Stanford Mayor Dalton Miller on Wednesday issued a State of Emergency in the city as water supply is “critically low.”

Miller signed the emergency to begin at 3 p.m. yesterday and continue until further notice.

He also directed the following in the order:

Local Emergency Operations Plan shall be fully executed

Emergency Management Director shall direct all City of Stanford agencies to provide such assistance as can delivered from available local resources and shall coordinate all agencies of local government provide assistance to the citizens of the City of Stanford

All agencies of the City of Stanford shall cooperate to the fullest extent with the Lincoln County Emergency Management Agency and shall provide such assistance as may be required for response to this emergency

Under this State of Emergency, as provided in KRS 39A the Mayor of the City of Stanford can waive procedures and formalities otherwise required by the law pertaining to: a) performance of public work, b) entering into contacts, c) incurring obligations, d) employment of permanent and temporary workers, e) utilization of volunteer workers, f) rental equipment, g) appropriations and expenditure of public funds

Miller says water reservoir levels are at critically low levels, which is creating a water shortage, due to drought conditions, receiving little to no rainfall and raw water supply consistently being below seasonal averages.

The city and Stanford Waterworks are asking residents to conserve water during this time.

A powerful late-autumn storm swept over the region Sunday night, bringing high winds and heavy rain that knocked out power for tens of thousands of residents.

On Monday, the storm dumped more than 4 inches of rain on parts of the state and produced wind gusts of up to 66 mph along the coast.

Eversource, the state’s largest electrical utility, reported more than 65,000 outages remained as of around 4:45 p.m. Monday. United Illuminating, which serves the greater Bridgeport and New Haven regions, reported more than 400 customers without power around that same time.

Eversource’s outages across the state appeared to peak above 85,000 around 9:30 a.m. Meanwhile, UI said its outages peaked at 6,800 around 6 a.m.

The storm caused “significant damage” to Eversource’s electric system Monday, Eversource Connecticut President Steve Sullivan said in a news conference that afternoon.

“This storm really hit across the entire state,” he said. “Every city, every town has some level of outages.”

He noted that this would be a “multi-day restoration.”

As of 4:45 p.m., the utility company restored power to 46 schools, though there were still 36 without electricity, according to Sullivan.

“We’re working very hard to try and get all of those schools back tonight, even if that means working late into the night,” he said. Sullivan noted that the company also has generators as a backup plan.

A spokesperson for UI said the company had prepared for as many as 10,000 outages. Most should see their power come back on within 12 hours, the spokesperson said, and that all should be fully restored within 24 to 48 hours.

The National Weather Service said the heavy rain brought on by the storm would “create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.”

Danbury was one such area to see standing water.

Bethel resident Robin Grant was driving her Subaru Impreza through Rodgers Park when she decided to ford a puddle.

“It was dark so I didn’t see not only that there was a puddle, but that the puddle went on,” she said. “By the time I got halfway through, I’m like, 'Well, I guess I’m in this, let’s see how far we can go.'”

Grant’s Subaru became stuck and submerged in the water, and she had to wait until a little before 9 a.m. for roadside assistance to tow her car. She believes her vehicle may be totaled, though she is safe.

“Don’t try to ford the puddle,” she said. “It’s not the Oregon Trail; we’re not going to make it across.”

In Greenwich, it wasn’t the flooding that caused problems for Andrea Dean but the wind.

Dean, a resident of Old Greenwich, had a rude awakening early Monday morning when a branch busted through her roof and into her bedroom.

“It startled me and woke me up,” she said. “I turned on my lamp and I saw the tree through the roof.”

She was not injured. When reached by phone in the morning, she was waiting for the building inspector to come by and hoped the branch would be removed and a tarp would be placed over the hole later in the day.

Roads in towns across the state were closed Monday morning due to flooding and fallen trees. In Middletown, an ambulance that went to pick up a sick child on Maromas Road was blocked from getting out by a fallen tree.

The South District Fire Department made a priority call to Eversource, who responded and the patient was OK, according to South District Fire Chief James Trzaski.

Guilford police reported more than a dozen roads fully or partially closed because of downed trees and wires. One tree fell on a patrol car, they said, but the officer was not injured.

In New Canaan, Emergency Management Director Russ Kimes said 10 roads in New Canaan are blocked by barricades because of downed wires, trees and branches and he urged all drivers to “Treat them all as if they are live and extremely dangerous.” Luckily, he said many other roads had reports of tree limbs down on wires, but were still passable.

The storm caused dozens of school districts to close, mostly in northeastern Connecticut, while dozens of others announced two or three-hour delays.

Hundreds of flights were canceled at New York area airports, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service, and Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks also saw delays.

Delays also cropped up on Metro-North Railroad, specifically the New Haven line, and the Cross Sound Ferry from New London to Long Island also canceled trips Monday.

The weather service’s New York office had forecasted up to 5 to 6 inches of rain could fall Monday morning. In Danbury, as much as 4.4 inches of rain fell on The Hat City, according to the weather service. Other parts of the state saw between 1 and 4 inches of rain.

In Stamford, wind gusts hit 66 mph, according to the weather service, while several other spots along the Connecticut shoreline also recorded winds in excess of 50 mph.

On Monday afternoon, most of the state was still under wind advisories, while high wind warnings were issued for areas along the coast until 4 p.m. The rain had mostly left the region by mid afternoon but a flood warning remained in effect until Monday evening in much of northern Connecticut.

The NWS said Connecticut on Tuesday would have clear and sunny skies, temperatures in the mid 40s and a light wind.

SYDNEY (Reuters) – Australia is bracing for an intense heatwave across its north and west during the New Year’s holiday weekend with temperatures forecast to touch more than 45 degrees Celsius (113°F), while severe thunderstorms were expected to hit the country’s east.

The heatwave follows a wild weather system that battered the country’s east over the Christmas holidays killing 10 people and knocking down power for tens of thousands, and after Cyclone Jasper earlier this month caused widespread flooding and damage.

Australia’s December-February summer is under the influence of the El Nino phenomenon, which usually brings above-average daytime temperatures, and can cause weather extremes ranging from wildfires to tropical cyclones and prolonged droughts.

Extreme heatwave conditions are forecast for large swathes of the state of Western Australia, with temperatures in Marble Bar, a remote old mining town in the northwest, expected to hit 49°C (120.2°F) on Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest update.

Queensland outback towns of Longreach and Julia Creek in the northeast are set to hit 47°C this weekend, while nighttime temperatures in many parts of the Northern Territory could remain in the low 30s for several days.

The intense heatwave has also prompted authorities to raise bushfire risks with several regions under total fire bans.

But in the east, thunderstorms are expected to redevelop from Friday across eastern Queensland and northeast New South Wales, continuing into the new year.

“Severe thunderstorms are possible … although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days. Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia,” said Sarah Scully, forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology.

Some storms in the east could become severe on Friday afternoon, with the potential for large hail, wind gusts of more than 90 kmh (56 mph) and heavy rain.

The storms were expected to ease by New Year’s Eve and not impact Sydney’s iconic fireworks display as the Bureau of Meteorology predicted cloudy conditions on Sunday with a very slight chance of rain.

Tommy DeVito mania

Prior to Monday’s matchup between the Giants and the Eagles, Art Stapleton revealed a fun story about Yankees captain Aaron Judge. Apparently, Judge and Giants QB Tommy DeVito were both at the same restaurant in NYC, and Judge paid DeVito’s bill.

Heard this last week + Tommy DeVito just confirmed with @PSchrags on @NFLonFOX pregame: he was out for dinner in NYC, saw Aaron Judge at another table and, at end of his meal, he was told by server Judge had picked up his tab.

DeVito was stunned Judge knew who he was.

#NYGiants — Art Stapleton (@art_stapleton) December 25, 2023

While, unfortunately, the day ended fairly poorly for DeVito — he was benched at halftime — this story is both a reminder of how much excitement Tommy Cutlets brought to a city craving a good sports story and yet another example of how awesome Aaron Judge is.

Masahiro Tanaka catches some basketball

There are a very many things we love about Masahiro Tanaka. He loved wearing the pinstripes (and still supports the Yankees), thrived in the biggest moments, and brought a level of passion and energy to the Stadium rarely matched. Unfortunately, nobody is perfect, and that imperfection lies in his choice of NYC basketball teams to support.

Don’t get me wrong, I am absolutely ecstatic that he still comes to New York regularly...I just wish he spent his time at Madison Square Garden, supporting Jalen Brunson and the real New York basketball team, and not the one that only claims one borough — arguably the most anti-Yankee borough.'",sports,baseball

"'JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed American support to Israel on Thursday as its military pulverized the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip with airstrikes and prepared for a possible ground invasion.

As Palestinians tried to stock up on bread and groceries amid dwindling supplies, Israel said nothing would be allowed into Gaza until around 150 hostages taken captive by Hamas during a weekend attack are freed.

International aid groups warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis after Israel halted deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to Gaza’s 2.3 million people and prevented entry of supplies from Egypt. The war has claimed at least 2,700 lives on both sides.

“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on, and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.

Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver” should political leaders order one. A ground offensive in Gaza, where the population is densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.

As Israel pounds Gaza from the air, Hamas militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Amid concerns that the fighting could spread in the region, Syrian state media reported that Israeli airstrikes on Thursday hit international airports in the Syrian capital, Damascus, and in the northern city of Aleppo, putting them out of service.

Palestinians fleeing airstrikes in Gaza could be seen running through the streets, carrying their belongings and looking for a safe place. The number of people who fled their homes reached 340,000 people by Wednesday night — roughly 15% of Gaza’s population. Most crowded into U.N.-run schools while others are staying with relatives or even strangers who let them in.

Lines formed outside bakeries and grocery stores during the few hours they dared open, as people tried to stock up before shelves emptied. On Wednesday, Gaza’s only power station ran out of fuel and shut down, leaving only lights powered by scattered private generators.

Hospitals, overwhelmed by a constant stream of wounded and running out of supplies, have only a few days worth of fuel before their power cuts off, aid officials say. The cut-off has also caused dire water shortage for over 650,000 people, according to the U.N.

“Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues,” warned Fabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross. When power runs out, it puts “newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can’t be taken,” he said.

With Israel sealing off the territory, the only way in or out is through the crossing with Egypt at Rafah. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said it has not officially closed Rafah but airstrikes have prevented it from operating. Egypt has been trying to convince Israel and the United States to allow the delivery of aid and fuel through Rafah.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “crush” Hamas after the militants stormed into the country’s south on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people, including killings of children in their homes and young people at a music festival. Netanyahu alleged Hamas atrocities, including beheading soldiers and raping women. His allegations could not be independently confirmed.

Amid grief and demands for vengeance among the Israeli public, the government is under intense pressure to topple Hamas rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza.

Four previous conflicts ended with the group still firmly in control of the territory it has ruled since 2007. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. A new war Cabinet, which includes a longtime opposition politician, is now directing the fight.

Blinken’s visit underscored American backing for Israel’s retaliation.

“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists you will never have to,” Blinken said after meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. “We will always be there by your side.”

Blinken is to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to parts of the occupied West Bank, and Jordan’s King Abdullah II.

Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in a 1967 war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state, but there have been no peace talks in over a decade.

In Gaza, the Israeli military said overnight strikes targeted Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces, including command centers used by the fighters who attacked Israel on Saturday, and the home of a senior Hamas naval operative that it said was used to store unspecified weapons. Other airstrikes killed commanders from two smaller militant groups, according to media linked to those organizations.

“Right now we are focused on taking out their senior leadership,” Hecht, the military spokesman, said of Hamas. “Not only the military leadership, but also the governmental leadership, all the way up to (top Hamas leader Yehia) Sinwar.”

Drone footage filmed by The Associated Press revealed extensive damage at the Shati refugee camp, in the north of Gaza, following overnight airstrikes. Residents picked their way through the rubble as fire and rescue crews looked for survivors.

While Israel has insisted that it is giving notice of its strikes, it is employing a new tactic of leveling whole neighborhoods, rather than just individual buildings.

Hecht said targeting decisions were based on intelligence and civilians were warned.

Even with the warnings, Palestinians say some are unable to escape or have nowhere to go, and that entire families have been crushed under rubble. In the Gaza town of Beit Lahia, Israeli planes dropped leaflets telling people to leave after strikes had heavily blasted the area, residents said.

Jaber Weshah, a 73-year-old rights activist, said there was no warning when a strike leveled a multi-story building neighboring his in the Bureij refugee camp early Wednesday. At least 12 people were killed, including a bookseller, his wife and two toddler daughters and six members of another family, residents said.

“It was an inferno,” Weshah said.

At least 1,000 homes have been leveled and 560 rendered uninhabitable by strikes, according to the U.N.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were killed in the West Bank on Thursday when Israeli settlers sprayed bullets at a funeral for three people killed in a settler rampage the day before. Footage showed Jewish settlers in their cars swerving into the funeral procession and cutting off the road before stopping and opening fire.

The Health Ministry says more than two dozen Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and two in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem since Saturday, most when police fired on stone-throwing protesters.

The death toll in Gaza rose to more than 1,400 killed, the Palestinian health ministry said.

The Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel, a staggering toll unseen since the 1973 war with Egypt and Syria that lasted weeks.

Thousands have been wounded on both sides.

Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead inside Gaza are Hamas members.

"'Climate disasters are costing the US billions of dollars a year, and the damage isn’t spread out evenly, according to a new national climate assessment.

The assessment, produced about every four years, lays out the toll climate change is taking across every region in the United States. This is the fifth one — but for the first time, this year’s report includes chapters dedicated to economic impact and social inequities. As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices.

As floods, fires, heatwaves, and other calamities tied to climate change intensify, households pay the price with higher costs and worsening environmental injustices

Climate change has created circumstances that the planet hasn’t seen for thousands of years, the report says. Global temperatures have risen faster over the past half-century than they have in at least 2,000 years. That’s led to all sorts of new threats, like the 2021 heatwave that killed more than 1,400 people in the typically temperate Pacific Northwest. And old problems get much bigger, like droughts sucking the Southwest dry. Drought in the Western US is currently more severe than it’s ever been in at least 1,200 years. Since 1980, drought and heatwaves alone have caused more than $320 billion in damages.

Extreme weather disasters make up some of the most devastating displays of climate change and are becoming way more common — and more costly. Back in the 1980s, a billion-dollar disaster hit the US once every four months on average (a figure that’s adjusted for inflation). Now, the US has to cope with one every three weeks. Those extreme events come with $150 billion in losses every year, according to the assessment. That’s a “conservative estimate that does not account for loss of life, healthcare-related costs, or damages to ecosystem services,” the report says.

There are also more insidious ways climate change takes a bite out of the US economy. Consumers have to shell out more money for food and other goods as prices reflect damages caused by climate change. In the Midwest, pests, diseases, and whiplash between wet and dry conditions linked to climate change threaten corn and apple harvests. And climate change has already supercharged 18 major fishery disasters in Alaska “that were especially damaging for coastal Indigenous Peoples, subsistence fishers, and rural communities,” according to the report.

None of these challenges are happening in a vacuum. Like pollution, climate disasters disproportionately affect Americans of color, low-income households, and other groups that have been historically marginalized. While 20 to 40 percent of small businesses that shutter after a natural disaster never open their doors again, those owned by women, people of color, and veterans are even more likely to close for good.

Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents

Flood losses are expected to balloon much faster in communities with a higher proportion of Black residents. Census tracts where at least 20 percent of the population is Black are projected to see average annual losses from floods rise at a rate twice as fast as other census tracks where less than 1 percent of the population is Black. It’s partly a symptom of racist housing policies like redlining that have left certain communities without the infrastructure and resources to cope with hazards brought on by climate change. Formerly redlined neighborhoods can also be around 12 degrees hotter than surrounding areas because of fewer green spaces and more paved surfaces that trap heat.

All of these risks grow as long as the US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and other countries keep running on fossil fuels. The world has warmed by a little more than 1 degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, and the report says 2 degrees of warming would more than double the economic toll from climate change.'",climate,heatwave
"'The release of former FBI director James Comey’s book coaxed Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times’s former, famously influential chief book critic out of retirement and, unusually, into the news pages of Friday’s edition. The online headline praised Comey’s Trump-bashing tome: “James Comey Has a Story to Tell. It’s Very Persuasive.”

Kakutani was given over 2,000 words and a full page in the News section to offer praise for A Higher Loyalty -- Truth, Lies, And Leadership, though the book evidently has no bombshell news to offer.

Newsbusters Scott Whitlock noticed, surprisingly, that even the anti-Trump mainstream press finds Comey’s book distasteful in its personal insults against Trump’s appearance (his hands, height, and skin tone). Yet the only criticism Kakutani managed was about the damage Comey purportedly did to Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

You know Kakutani likes a book when she just quotes it ad nauseum:

In his absorbing new book, “A Higher Loyalty,” the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey calls the Trump presidency a “forest fire” that is doing serious damage to the country’s norms and traditions. “This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values,” Comey writes. “His leadership is transactional, ego driven and about personal loyalty.” .... The central themes that Comey returns to throughout this impassioned book are the toxic consequences of lying; and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty to an individual over truth and the rule of law. Dishonesty, he writes, was central “to the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic,” and so, too, were bullying, peer pressure and groupthink -- repellent traits shared by Trump and company, he suggests, and now infecting our culture.

She overegged her already distorted account of the two personalities:

Put the two men’s records, their reputations, even their respective books, side by side, and it’s hard to imagine two more polar opposites than Trump and Comey: They are as antipodean as the untethered, sybaritic Al Capone and the square, diligent G-man Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma’s 1987 movie “The Untouchables”; or the vengeful outlaw Frank Miller and Gary Cooper’s stoic, duty-driven marshal Will Kane in Fred Zinnemann’s 1952 classic “High Noon.” One is an avatar of chaos with autocratic instincts and a resentment of the so-called “deep state” who has waged an assault on the institutions that uphold the Constitution.

Strangely, the only flaws Kakutani finds involve Comey’s handling of Clinton’s classified document scandal, which sore liberals believe cost her the election. After noting Comey wrote his thesis on Christian theologian Richard Niebuhr and the sins of pride: Those characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comey’s account of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, wherein he seems to have felt a moral imperative to address, in a July 2016 press conference, what he described as her “extremely careless” handling of “very sensitive, highly classified information,” even though he went on to conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her....

Kakutani is not nearly so pleased with books that criticize Democratic presidents. In 2017 she called Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Garrow’s 1,460-page book that included unflattering depictions of the future president to be “a condescending diatribe unworthy of a serious historian.”

Kakutani is the author of the forthcoming book The Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump, which certainly sounds like a moderate take.'",climate,heatwave

"'Compound extreme events, defined as those where multiple climate extremes converge, often result in more severe and devastating impacts than individual events. Specifically, spatially compounding events, where different climate hazards co-occur across neighboring regions, have been a focus of concern.

Researchers from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and their collaborators have delved into the realm of compound extreme events, revealing their heightened risk due to human-induced climate change.

The study was published in Weather and Climate Extremes on Oct. 11.

The researchers developed a framework for attributing spatially compounding events involving two different hazards. They used a storyline-probability combined model, which enhanced the confidence in attribution statements. Additionally, they introduced a novel constructed flow analogues method to assess the dynamic effects contributing to such events.

Presenting a case study on the 2020 spatially compounding heavy precipitation and heatwave event in China, the research team found that dynamic and thermodynamic factors accounted for 51% (35-67%) and 39% (18-59%) of the event's intensity, respectively. Moreover, their analysis revealed that anthropogenic climate change has increased the likelihood of similar events by at least tenfold.

Projections indicate that compared to the current climate, these events may become ten and fourteen times more probable by the mid and late 21st century, respectively, under a high-emissions scenario. Notably, adopting a low-emissions scenario could reduce this likelihood to seven times more probable.

This study not only sheds light on the profound influence of anthropogenic climate change on high-impact compound extreme events but also underscores the urgent need for greenhouse gas emissions reduction.'",climate,heatwave

"'Heavy surf smacked San Luis Obispo County’s coastline on Thursday, sending waves over seawalls, flooding beachfront streets, and causing multiple water rescues.

While the surf mellowed out on Friday, another day of high surf is forecast for Saturday — bringing with it a risk of flooding in low-lying coastal areas.

The San Luis Obispo County Office of Emergency Services advised people to stay away from the waterline this weekend — and especially avoid walking or driving on the beach, according to agency director Scott Jalbert.

People can sign up for the county’s emergency alerts at bit.ly/3vhxLoV.

Large waves hammer the Avila Beach Pier on Thursday, Dec. 29, 2023.

More high surf to splash SLO County

The National Weather Service issued a high surf warning for San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties through 10 p.m. Saturday.

Powerful cyclones in the Pacific Ocean cause the high swells, which create “extremely dangerous conditions” on the beaches, according to the Weather Service’s forecast discussion.

The Weather Service predicted the swells would subside on Thursday afternoon but increase again over the weekend — causing more high surf and the potential for coastal flooding through Saturday.

Breaking waves on the Central Coast will continue to be 10 to 15 feet tall with the potential for 25 feet, the Weather Service said.

“These are forecast to be extremely dangerous conditions, as powerful waves and life-threatening rip currents pose an exceptional risk of ocean drowning and damage to coastal structures such as piers and jetties,” the Weather Service wrote in Friday’s forecast discussion.

The Weather Service also issued a coastal flood warning for the San Luis Obispo County coast through Saturday evening — especially in low-lying coastal areas around the morning high tides.

In its daily forecast, the Weather Service said astronomical tides are “running a few to several tenths of a foot above normal,” and high tide will range from 5.7 feet to 6.5 feet.

That, coupled with the tides being at the peak of their monthly maximum, increased the risk of coastal flooding, the agency said.

“Overall, this is expected to be an exceptional high-surf and coastal flooding event that has not occurred in many years,” the Weather Service said. “Take caution and heed the direction of local authorities and lifeguards.”

On Friday, San Luis Obispo will be mostly cloudy with a 40% chance of rain, according to the National Weather Service. There’s 100% chance of rain starting at 10 p.m. on Friday night with the potential for thunderstorms.

According to the Weather Service, San Luis Obispo could get up to one inch of rain on Friday night.

In Paso Robles, there’s a 30% chance of rain on Friday that increases to 100% in the evening, with the potential to receive up to a quarter inch of rain, the Weather Service said.

On Saturday, there’s an 80% chance of rain before 10 a.m. in San Luis Obispo along with the possibly of a thunderstorm. Less rain should fall on Saturday, with the potential for less than a tenth of an inch.

On Saturday night, there’s a 10% chance of rain after 4 a.m. with an increase in cloud cover, according to the weather service.

Paso Robles will receive most of its rain on Saturday before 10 a.m., while heavy clouds are expected to blanket the city on Saturday night.

On New Year’s Eve, San Luis Obispo has a 30% chance of rain showers after 10 a.m. and a 40% chance of rain Sunday night before 4 a.m., according to the National Weather Service.

In Paso Robles, there’s a 30% chance of rain after 10 a.m. on New Year’s Eve, and a 20% chance of rain on New Year’s Day.

"'Officials in Henderson County said in a social media post that the 431-acre fire has destroyed two homes, a cabin and an outbuilding.

Example video title will go here for this video

HENDERSONVILLE, N.C. — Officials have declared a state of emergency in a western North Carolina community where a wildfire has burned hundreds of acres, some structures and now is threatening dozens of homes.

Crews are fighting several separate blazes in forested areas of Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky as wide swaths of those states face moderate to severe drought conditions and warmer-than-normal temperatures.

The 431-acre (174-hectare) fire in Henderson County, North Carolina, has destroyed two homes, a cabin and an outbuilding, county officials said in a social media post-Sunday that declared a state of emergency. Officials have identified 75 other structures that are threatened and said fire departments are focusing on structure protection while North Carolina Forest Services is focusing on putting in fire lines.

Meanwhile, crews are fighting a blaze in Cherokee County that has grown to more than 2,100 acres (850 hectares), but is not threatening structures, the U.S. Forest Service said.

The North Carolina Forest Service issued a burn ban Sunday for 14 counties in the western part of the state due to hazardous forest fire conditions and said it would stay in effect until further notice.

“Several counties in Western North Carolina are currently in a severe drought, and we are seeing wildfire activity increase due to dry conditions. Because dry conditions are expected to continue this burn ban is necessary to reduce the risk of fires starting and spreading quickly,"" the statement said.

In Virginia, the state Department of Forestry said a wildfire near Madison County has led officials to encourage some residents to evacuate as crews work to stop the blaze from spreading. That fire had burned nearly 2,500 acres (1,012 hectares) on Sunday, but no structures have been affected and firefighters were installing additional fire lines to maintain that, the agency said.

In eastern Kentucky, where conditions were also dry, the top official in Harlan County issued a burn ban and a state of emergency on Sunday, saying there had been six forest fires in the last three days “that has caused a significant strain on first responder agencies.”

Two firefighters were injured “while attempting to protect life and property,” Harlan County Judge-Executive Dan Mosley said.

Crews were fighting two fires in East Tennessee including one in Rocky Top, but no injuries have been reported and no structures are in danger, Anderson County officials told news outlets.

Clinton Fire Department Lt. Daniel Adams said the area is very dry and that combined with leaves covering the ground create ripe conditions for brush fires.

“Anything as simple as a cigarette being flicked out your window or disregarding some ashes — stuff we wouldn’t be as concerned about right now — we are tremendously concerned about because of the dryness,” Adams told WBIR-TV.

Other parts of the U.S. are seeing unseasonably warmer temperatures and dry conditions this week. The Dallas-Fort Worth area saw highs in the 80s, about 10 degrees warmer than average. Milder weather also stretched into the Midwest, where Wichita, Kansas, was seeing temperatures stretch toward 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). A cold front creeping into the Central and Southern Plains later in the week was expected to push highs down to normal for this time of year.'",climate,heatwave
"'MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The USDA Forest Service has followed suit after Gov. Kay Ivey’s Wednesday order in which she issued a statewide “no burn” order, prohibiting all outdoor burning in Alabama. The state order went into effect Thursday at 8 a.m.

“This declaration is meant to prevent unnecessary burning, reducing the chance of avoidable fires,” Ivey said of the state order. “I urge Alabamians to heed this warning.”

Thursday, the USDA Forest Service announced an identical ban in Alabama’s National Forests, meaning visitors planning trips to recreation sites, trails, hunter camps, or primitive forested areas throughout the Bankhead, Conecuh, Talladega and Tuskegee national forests are not allowed to use any fire or fireworks due to extreme drought conditions.

Since the statewide fire alert was issued on Oct. 24, Alabama Forestry Commission firefighters have responded to more than 350 wildfires that have burned 3,199 acres across the state, according to the governor’s office.

The USDA Forest Service and Alabama Forestry Commission have a long-standing partnership in fighting wildfires. “Wildfires do not stop at property boundaries,” said USDA Forest Service Acting Forest Supervisor Dagmar Thurmond. “The Forest Service is committed to working with partners to reduce the risk of wildfires in Alabama communities. Communicating to the public a “no fire” alert on federal national forest lands is essential.”

A statewide ‘No Burn Order’ will be in effect in Alabama November 9 at 8:00 a.m.

“During the last month, we’ve seen an increase not only in the number of wildfires, but also in the size of those fires,” explained state forester Rick Oates. “With this prolonged drought, conditions are such that any outdoor fire can rapidly spread out of control, taking longer – and more firefighting resources – to contain and ultimately control. “Even though we are predicted to get a small amount of rain this weekend, it will not be enough to lessen the wildfire danger.”

The state’s no burn order will remain in effect until rescinded by the state forester, when conditions have changed sufficiently to reduce the occurrence and frequency of wildfires. You should call your local law enforcement to report people who are burning in violation of this law.

The Alabama Forestry Commission issued these guidelines on the state’s burn order:

WHAT IS THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY DECLARATION? Section 9-13-141 of the Code of Alabama states: “at such time as the state forestry commission has declared by regulation a drought emergency in any county or counties, it shall be unlawful in such county or counties for any person to set fire to any forest, grass, woods, wildlands or marshes or to build a campfire or bonfire or to burn trash or other material that may cause a forest, grass or woods fire.”

This prohibition has been put in place in all 67 counties in Alabama. Specifically, the regulation prohibits any prescribed burns, any campfire or bonfire, any trash or debris fires, or any other open burning.

“WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ‘CAMPFIRE OR BONFIRE’ PROHIBITION? Campfires or bonfires include any fire that is burned on bare ground, even if surrounded by stones or in open dirt pits. This includes campfires, ceremonial fires, ‘council’ fires, bonfires, ‘warming’ fires, and cooking fires that are on bare-ground and not in a masonry lined ‘pit.’”

“DOES THE PROHIBITION INCLUDE BARBEQUES? Barbeque fires for cooking are allowed IF the fire is in a grill or masonry barbeque pit, including large barbeque pits used by civic organizations to prepare food. Anyone grilling or barbequing during the Drought Emergency should have water hoses on site to prevent any loose sparks from setting a wildfire, a circle at least 10 feet wide around the grill should be cleared of any burnable material. Side fires to generate coals for a barbeque must also be within a grill or masonry pit. Gas grills are allowed.”

“WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ‘TRASH OR DEBRIS FIRE’ PROHIBITION? Trash and debris fires include burning of woody debris, yard waste, garbage, construction debris or any other material, in either an open pit or in a barrel. At this point in time, people should not burn a debris pile until the Drought Emergency is lifted. Tornado debris can be disposed of at one of the ADEM or EMA approved sites. Check with your local authorities for the nearest location.

WHAT OTHER THINGS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DROUGHT EMERGENCY? The intent of the Drought Emergency Declaration is to prevent catastrophic wildfires during drought conditions. No one should have open flames in a woodland setting. At campsites, only closed lanterns may be used, not open flames like candles and ‘tiki torches.’ Care should also be exercised in suburban areas where lawns are also very dry. Fireworks are prohibited during a Drought Emergency as well.”

“WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THESE REGULATIONS? Under Section 9-13-142, Code of Alabama, anyone found guilty of violating these regulations and improperly doing open burning in a Drought Emergency declared area shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $250 nor more than $500 and, at the discretion of the court, that person may also be sentenced to the county jail for up to six months. Additionally, any person burning in violation of the Drought Emergency Declaration, will be liable for damages to the property of another and any costs associated with the suppression of said fire. Suppression costs would include equipment and personnel costs related to control or extinguish the wildfire.”

"'SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Borislav Mihaylov, the controversial president of the Bulgarian soccer federation and a former national team goalkeeper, resigned Monday following mass protests against him.

A new president will be elected at a federation congress next year.

Several thousand soccer fans had taken to the streets in recent weeks to demand the resignation of Mihaylov, the goalkeeper on the Bulgaria team that reached the semifinals at the 1994 World Cup.

The fury was fueled by the federation’s decision to play a European Championship qualifying match against Hungary on Oct. 16 in an empty stadium, and longer-term unhappiness with the national team’s decline.

Additional pressure for the resignation came from the country’s prime minister, Nikolay Denkov, who urged in a letter to FIFA president Gianni Infantino to take “decisive action” by removing Mihaylov as federation leader and installing an interim management.

The letter, which was published on the government website, cited “long-amassed criticism and dissatisfaction of football clubs” with soccer leadership in the country. It also pointed out that FIFA’s statutes grant it the power to remove member federation leaders “under exceptional circumstances.”

On Monday, Mihaylov rejected all claims about “criticism by the soccer clubs” and snapped at reporters that only reason to quit was “to calm everyone down.” He added that his resignation was not requested by any of the soccer clubs.

Mihaylov did not comment on the investigation that Bulgaria’s chief prosecutor launched recently into the country’s soccer management, with the focus on the actions of the federation president.

The prosecutor’s probe comes after numerous media reports alleging a range of violations and potential criminal activities, including the misappropriation of public funds and involvement in illicit betting schemes.

Mihaylov was first elected in 2005 to lead the national soccer federation. The men’s national team has slumped under his leadership and has not qualified for a major tournament since Euro 2004.

Mihaylov was out of office for 18 months after he resigned in 2019 under pressure from the government. He left one day after Bulgaria fans made Nazi salutes and targeted England’s Black players with racial abuse during a Euro 2020 qualifying game in Sofia.

"'The WNBA is competing for TV viewers during one of the busiest times on the sports calendar, and the league is holding its own with no plans to turn back the clock.

Through two games, the best-of-five series between the top-seeded Las Vegas Aces and the second-seeded New York Liberty is the most-watched WNBA Finals in 20 years.

The title round opened on an NFL Sunday last weekend, and the Aces' 99-82 victory over the Liberty was the most-viewed Game 1 since ESPN started broadcasting the WNBA Finals in 1998. Game 2 on Wednesday night, a 104-76 win by Las Vegas, was played with the MLB postseason in full swing.

""I think whatever time frame you're operating in, there's going to be competition. It's about continuing to try to grow your product,"" said NBA analyst Doris Burke of ESPN, who called WNBA games during its early years. ""I don't think there's any doubt you can see the evolution of the players and the coaching in the WNBA. And I expect that trajectory to continue.""

The numbers are trending in the WNBA's favor.

Viewership for the two games is up 13% over last year's matchup between the Aces and the Connecticut Sun. Game 1 on ABC averaged 729,000 viewers, and the average was 626,000 for Game 2 on ESPN. The two-game average of 680,000 is a bump the league hopes continues.

This will be the latest finish to a WNBA season in a year without a Summer Olympics, but playing later into the fall is not new for the league. It's the 13th time in the WNBA's 27-year history its title series has either started or stretched into October. When the league was launched in 1997, the schedule ended in August.

An expanded regular season and playoffs have pushed the end of the WNBA season into head-to-head competition with regular-season games for both the NFL and NHL, the MLB playoffs and the NBA preseason.

When the WNBA debuted in 1997 with eight teams, its season was completed before Labor Day. The league continues to operate in a condensed time frame. The WNBA's collective bargaining agreement states the earliest the season can start is April 1 and that it must end by Oct. 31. But not factoring in the pandemic-altered seasons of 2020 and 2021, the league has gone from a 34-game regular season from 2003 to 2019, to 36 games in 2022 to 40 this year.

Beginning last year, the playoffs also expanded to best-of-three series in the first round and best-of-five semifinals and finals. The altering of the playoff format was one of the primary objectives of the WNBA Players Association during its last round of CBA negotiations.

TRADEOFFS FOR PLAYOFFS

The change created some tradeoffs for the league.

More games and arena availability also means sometimes the playoffs doesn't get top billing. ESPN2 ended up carrying a playoff doubleheader on a Friday night because ESPN had college football. Still, according to the WNBA, regular-season games on CBS and ESPN averaged 505,000 viewers, an 8% increase over last year. The Sunday afternoon games on ABC averaged 627,000, the most since 2012.

Going into the title series, though, playoff viewership was averaging 400,000, an 8% decline over last year. However, Game 2 of the semifinal series between the Connecticut Sun and New York Liberty on Sept. 26, a Tuesday night, averaged 563,000 on ESPN, the largest audience for a playoff game outside of the finals on cable since 2001.

When asked during her annual news conference before the start of the WNBA Finals why the long periods between playoff series, league commissioner Cathy Engelbert cited the number of regular-season games as one factor.

""It's just the nature of the broadcast windows, and how that played out this year and how long the series went,"" Engelbert said. ""We also played 40 games this year, so I think some of the rest actually should come in handy.""

John Kosner, who runs his own digital and sports consulting company, said even though the playoffs are taking place during a busy time on the sports calendar, there are more people watching television during the fall, which brings opportunities to get a sampling from a broader audience.

""The reality of the WNBA season is that the league has to make tradeoffs. The fact is no time of the year is clear, and running from spring until now makes the most sense for first-rate arenas,"" he said.

It helps to have the star power of this year's WNBA Finals. League MVP Breanna Stewart and sharpshooting Sabrina Ionescu headline a New York team in the title round for the first time since 2002; the Aces under coach Becky Hammon and led by last year's league MVP, A'ja Wilson, are trying to become the league's first repeat champions since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02.

""When you have a marquee matchup, like the Las Vegas Aces and now New York, that's what the old days used to be. That's what we were getting back to,"" Aces team president Nikki Fargas said before Wednesday's Game 2. ""And I think the fan base is understanding that not only are we going to follow you and support you in person, if I can't be there, then I'm going to support you and watch you.""

AP photo by John Locher / Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson, left, and guard Jackie Young celebrate after a play against the visiting New York Liberty during Game 2 of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday.



BUILDING ON BUMP

The league also has tried to make better use of the popularity of the NCAA women's basketball tournament as a springboard to the start of its season. That includes the draft, which takes place in mid-April, generally less than two weeks after March Madness is over.

The promotion is expected to intensify during next year's tournament with Iowa's Caitlin Clark, Connecticut's Paige Bueckers and LSU's Angel Reese on the horizon, as well as next year's Paris Olympics. And that women's college basketball audience has traditionally followed those players into the WNBA.

The ratings bump will surely be a topic of discussion during upcoming TV contract negotiations.

The WNBA's television contract expires in 2025. ESPN/ABC has the entire postseason and the WNBA All-Star Game while Scripps, Amazon's Prime Video and CBS have some regular-season and Commissioner's Cup games.

The league will receive $33 million from ESPN/ABC for the final season in 2025, but it could experience significant growth beyond that. A new media rights deal with additional partners would increase revenue. Multiple carriers for the postseason could even make the playoff schedule more compact.

""I'll go back to the NBA at a point in history in which they were on tape delay,"" Burke said. ""It takes some time to grow the fandom and get these players to be front and center in the minds of the nation's sports fans. But it feels to me like A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Chelsea Gray are becoming more known to the casual sports fan.""'",sports,basketball
"'Among patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels decreased in response to treatment with patisiran or vutrisiran, according to study results presented at the 2023 American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) Annual Meeting, held from November 1 to 4 in Phoenix, Arizona.

Researchers have suggested the role of NfL as a potential biomarker of disease progression and treatment response in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.

In the study, the researchers analyzed NfL levels among patients with hATTR amyloidosis receiving treatment with patisiran or vutrisiran. For the analysis, the researchers included data from patients in the APOLLO and HELIOS-A trials. They measured NfL plasma levels at various timepoints in the control and treatment groups.

“ NfL may serve as a biomarker of treatment response as early as 4 months following initiation of patisiran or vutrisiran.

The researchers found that NfL levels were higher among patients in the APOLLO than the HELIOS-A study (69.4 vs 58.2 pg/mL, respectively).

Among patients in the APOLLO study, those who received placebo had increasing levels of NfL vs those who received patisiran who had decreasing levels of NfL at 4 and 18 months. Similar observations were made among patients in the HELIOS-A study who had decreases in NfL levels from baseline with patisiran and vutrisiran treatment at 4 and 18 months (Table).

Table: NfL levels with placebo vs patisiran/vutrisiran at 4 and 18 months among patients in the APOLLO and HELIOS-A trials

APOLLO Study Placebo (pg/mL) Patisiran (pg/mL) P Value 4 months 19.0 -20.0 P <.001 18 months 36.3 -23.2 P <.001 HELIOS-A Study Patisiran (pg/mL) Vutrisiran (pg/mL) P Value 4 months -9.7 -11.0 P <.05 18 months -16.4 19.9 P <.001

Based on these findings, the researchers noted, “NfL may serve as a biomarker of

treatment response as early as 4 months following initiation of patisiran or vutrisiran.” They concluded, [NfL may be] “potentially useful for monitoring disease progression and treatment response in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.”'",sports,football

"'ATLANTA — Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr Wednesday announced his office’s Gang Prosecution Unit has secured a 52-count indictment charging three alleged gang members with a variety of drug and weapons offenses.

Chiquille Bell, Contrellis Books, and Marcus Thornton are accused of violating the state’s Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, trafficking oxycodone, possession with intent to distribute amphetamines, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, as well as other charges.

The three allegedly took part in criminal street gang activity while associated with the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips, a street gang based in Los Angeles with a large presence in Atlanta.

The indictment in Fulton County stems from Operation Heatwave led by the Atlanta Police Department (APD), a summer-long effort that brought together local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to target gangs, guns, and drugs in the most violent parts of the city.

Working with Gov. Brian Kemp, Carr created Georgia’s first statewide Gang Prosecution Unit last year. In its second year, the seven-agency operation made 96 arrests, including the apprehension of 41 suspected gang members and the recovery of 62 guns.

“This indictment is further proof of the results we’re able to achieve when all levels of law enforcement come together to do one thing — protect the people of our state,” Carr said Wednesday. “We’re proud to be part of this effort alongside our partners at APD.”

Carr credited Operation Heatwave with reducing homicides in Atlanta this year by 24% compared to 2022, while robbery fell by 40% and aggravated assault dropped by 11%. Violent crime overall in the city is down 21% so far this year.

“After a year of not competing, it is time to come back,"" Nadal said in a video posted on social media. ""It will be in Brisbane in the first week of January. See you there.”

The 37-year-old Spaniard has not played on tour since last January, when he hurt his hip flexor during a loss in the second round of the Australian Open.

In May, a little more than a week before the start of the French Open, Nadal announced that he would miss the tournament he’s won a record 14 times and wasn’t exactly sure when he might return to play.

Nadal had said then that he hoped to compete in 2024, which he expected to be his final season.

“You never know how things will turn out,” Nadal said at a news conference at the time, “but my intention is that next year will be my last year.”

He wound up having arthroscopic surgery in June in Barcelona.

Dating to the end of 2022, the Spanish left-hander has lost seven of his past nine matches, including going 1-3 this season.

Nadal's 22 Grand Slam singles titles rank second to Novak Djokovic’s 24 for the most among men.

Taylor Swift's NFL era: As the end of the 2023 NFL regular season nears, it's clear the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season was Taylor Swift (Travie Kelce, too). Swift's appearances at NFL stadiums including Lambeau, Gillette and Arrowhead sent Swifties of all ages into a frenzy that nearly overwhelmed the league itself. Football purists found the intrusion and Swift-related attention unnerving, but the pop sensation brought millions of new fans to the game. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be going strong, which means fans can expect to see Taylor herself in the stands of Kansas City Chiefs games as her schedule allows. Football fans may find it slightly annoying. But if the attention (and new audience) Taylor brought to professional NFL football just by showing up wasn't proof enough, it's Taylor's world and we're all just living in it -- one era at a time.

Is this the Cowboys year? Being a Dallas Cowboys fan requires a Texas-sized emotional commitment. Last season, fans gutted through quarterback Dak Prescott's winning record (not in a good way) of most interceptions thrown in the 2022-2023 season. Dak whittled his interceptions down this season and the Cowboys managed the unthinkable -- they toppled the mighty Philadelphia Eagles from their perch atop the NFC East in Week 14. But the Cowboys' 31-10 upset loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15 is the kind of play that makes Cowboys fans weary. The Cowboys could go all the way to the Super Bowl this season, but it won't be without taking Cowboys fans on an emotional rollercoaster best left at an amusement park.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different. Lamar is poised to have the best seasons of his career. MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already making a case to turn those MVP chants into reality. If you don't mind being called a ""bandwagon"" by the teenager in your life, there's never been a better time to jump on the Ravens bandwagon. We won't tell and neither should you.'",sports,football

"'Little League® International mourns the passing of James L. Easton, former president and CEO of Easton incorporated, founder of the Easton Foundations, and supporter of Little League for more than 50 years. He was 88.

Mr. Easton, a native of Los Angeles, was a 1959 graduate of the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA), earning a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering.

Professionally, Mr. Easton began his career working for the Douglas Aircraft Company. In the late 1960s, Mr. Easton joined his father’s company (Jas. Easton Inc.), and along with his brother, Bob, was integral in developing the first aluminum baseball bats and other alloy-based sporting equipment. Years later, Mr. Easton assumed the position of chairman, chief executive officer, and president of the Easton company.

For more than 40 years, Easton Baseball/Softball has been the “Official Team Equipment Supplier” of Little League and each year the organization provides equipment to participants at both the Little League Baseball and Softball World Series tournaments.

“Inspired and determined to help others, Jim saw Little League as a vehicle to provide opportunity to children and communities,” said Stephen D. Keener, Little League President and CEO. “He devoted a generous portion of his life to promoting youth projects and programs. His contributions to our organization, and his dedication and passion for the mission of youth sports has helped us provide memorable experiences to children in communities all around the world and teach life lessons through the games of baseball and softball.”

Mr. Easton helped lead the sports equipment industry to strengthen its focus on the growth and development of youth sports, especially baseball and softball. As a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1994 to 2006, he also helped coordinate the support and international growth of youth sports, including Little League. Mr. Easton sold the Easton company in 2006, but his dedication to youth sports and the Little League program continued through the support of The Easton Foundation which he founded in 2007.

Among the Little League projects impacted by the Easton Foundations were installation of digital scoreboards at each of the Little League’s five regional centers in the United States, and three video boards that have enhanced the fan experience at the Little League Baseball® World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. At the 2022 Little League International Congress, Mr. Easton was honored with the Peter O’Malley Distinguished Little League Ambassador Award.

Pay Tribute to James L. Easton

An avid archer, Mr. Easton served as president of the World Archery Federation from 1989 to 2005. He guided the sport of archery through a competition modernization and was instrumental in establishing the federation’s first professional office.

A tight, three-way MVP race showed up on the All-WNBA Teams, as each of the three candidates was a unanimous pick for the first team, the league announced Sunday during “WNBA Countdown” ahead of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals.

New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart, Las Vegas Aces forward A’ja Wilson and Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas were selected to the first team on all 60 ballots. They were joined by Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier and Dallas Wings forward Satou Sabally. Voting is positionless for the first and second teams.

The All-WNBA Second Team included three players in the WNBA Finals: the Aces’ Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray, and the Liberty’s Sabrina Ionescu. Also making the second team were Los Angeles Sparks forward Nneka Ogwumike and Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd.

Ogwumike is the longest-tenured player on the lists with her sixth selection.

Stewart, who was named 2023 MVP, earned her fifth first-team honor, while Wilson was selected for the third time and also earned the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year award. Thomas is a first-time selection, although she has been on the second team twice.

Wilson, who has led the Aces to the brink of a second straight championship, averaged a career-high 22.8 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.23 blocks per game in the regular season. Her 55.7% from the field also was the highest of her six-year career. The blocks mark was the best in the league. She had 22 double-doubles.

Stewart, in her first season with the Liberty, had a career year, averaging 23 points, 9.3 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game. She notched 20 double-doubles in the regular season and finished second in the league in scoring.

Thomas nearly averaged a triple-double this season with 15.5 points, 9.9 rebounds and 7.9 assists per game. No player in WNBA history had ever averaged a 7-7-7 season. She also had a single-season record six triple-doubles.

That trio also made the All-WNBA Defensive Team earlier this postseason.

For being selected to the first team, players receive $10,300 and second-team honorees receive $5,150.'",sports,basketball

The NFL Person of the Year: It's clear that Taylor Swift isn't just the 2023 woman of the year, she's the 2023 person of the year -- or so says Forbes and Time Magazine. With the accolade comes one of Swift's most in-depth interviews to date, in which she gives insight into her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, whom she began dating long before attending her first Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium. The takeaway for football fans and Taylor Swift fans is that Swift and Kelce appear to be more than a fleeting romance. Fans should expect to see Swift in the stands at Arrowhead (and on the road) for the foreseeable future. Clearly, the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season wasn't Aaron Rodgers' move to New York or Brock Purdy's dominance, but Swift herself.

Is this the Cowboys year? If you are a Dallas Cowboys fan, every year is ""the"" year (the one where the team goes all the way to the Super Bowl), but this year the 10-3 Cowboys actually have a shot. At the end of the 2022 season, quarterback Dak Prescott promised to throw less turnovers (he led the league with 15). As of today's writing, Dak managed his interceptions to just six. With superstars like Brandin Cooks and Micah Parsons on the field, the Cowboys have never looked better. The Cowboys toppled the Philadelphia Eagles from their perch in Week 14, beating them 33-13 and taking over the NFC East. The Cowboys year? They're certainly on the path.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different with Jackson scoring 644 rushing yards, the top for QBs in the NFL. Lamar is poised to have the best season of his career. The Ravens are 10-3 coming into Week 15 and MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already making a case to turn those MVP chants into reality.'",sports,football
"'CNN —

Demand for high-speed rail travel is booming in Europe. Travelers are desperate for a fast, sustainable alternative to short-haul air flights and congested highways.

But there’s a problem.

Demand is outstripping supply on many routes. Trains are full and prices are often sky high, forcing many travelers to use less eco-friendly modes of transport.

Europeans want more routes and more trains on existing routes between major cities where expansion is currently being stifled by inadequate capacity, political issues and underinvestment.

Unlike airlines, which can add new routes within months, it takes decades and billions of dollars to build new high-speed railways, especially where they cross international borders.

Right now, one of the biggest bottlenecks is the Channel Tunnel, the undersea rail link between Britain and France that is the domain of Eurostar, the high-speed train service linking London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.

Eurostar competes with airlines on busy European air routes but cannot currently exploit the huge untapped demand due to station capacity issues in London, Paris and Amsterdam – and a chronic shortage of border control staff in the UK.

While there’s plenty of room on the dedicated high-speed railways it uses in the UK, Belgium, France and the Netherlands, and through the Channel Tunnel, border staff cannot process enough passengers each hour to fill the 900-seat trains.

That means some have been departing with seats unoccupied. Adding more trains would overwhelm its city center stations (Eurostar says it’s halting services between London and Amsterdam for six months from June 2024 while upgrades to the service’s terminal in the Netherlands were being made.)

However, change could be on the way before the end of this decade.

After almost 30 years of monopoly, Eurostar is suddenly facing a raft of new challengers on its core international routes, with competition offering the prospect of more trains, more choice and lower fares.

Eurostar is halting services to Amsterdam for six months from June 2024. Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock

‘Ten times nicer than by plane’

London could gain additional high-speed trains to Belgium and the Netherlands under ambitious plans unveiled by new startup Heuro on November 14.

Established by a trio of Dutch entrepreneurs, Heuro aims to compete directly with Eurostar on the Amsterdam-Paris/London routes from 2028, offering up to 15 trips per day to London and 16 to Paris.

Inspired by the success of Italian private operator Italo and high-speed rail competition in Spain and France, Heuro’s founders are keen to shift travelers from air to rail on some of Europe’s busiest short-haul air routes.

“We just want lower prices and more people off planes and on trains,” says Heuro founder Roemer van den Biggelaar.

“There are still 55 flights [a day] from Amsterdam to London and back, which I think is a lot,” he adds. “And that’s while there is a very nice tunnel with a high-speed line.

“Personally, I also find travelling by train 10 times nicer than by plane. Towards London there are still capacity problems in terms of passport control, but something like that can be solved.

“The Eurostar is often quite full. If we start running trains there too, we hope the prices will drop.”

Heuro has not yet revealed what its tickets would cost, but it plans to undercut Eurostar and will add more connections to other cities if it is successful. Eurostar has said it does not comment on such announcements and is focused on growing sustainable travel in Europe.

High-speed rail competition in Italy and Spain has helped to increase service frequencies, reduce fares by up to 40% and grow the market by up to 300% on some routes over the last decade, according to figures published by ALLRail, which represents non-state train operators in the European rail market.

ALLRail President Erich Forster welcomed the Heuro announcement, saying: “Competition in Italy has led to more choice and more trains. It is clearly the solution for the northwest European high-speed rail market as well.

“Put simply, start-ups such as Heuro are the future of passenger rail. We look forward to an alternative to the current situation where - with only one operator [Eurostar] – the market is chronically underserved.”

A Virgin rebirth?

Heuro’s announcement came just three days after British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported that Richard Branson’s Virgin empire wants to return to the rail sector to compete with Eurostar, four years after its last UK contract.

Although the story was dismissed as speculation by Virgin, the report suggested that a former Virgin Trains boss has been lined up to head the new international rail operation connecting London and Paris.

Branson has previously said he feels he has “unfinished business” in the rail sector and Virgin could become a formidable competitor to Eurostar if the rumors prove to be true.

Also backed by wealthy investors, Spanish startup Evolyn was the first to show its hand in October.

It announced plans to challenge Eurostar on the Paris-London route from 2025, with the full service starting in 2026. However, rail industry experts have expressed serious doubts about whether this target is achievable.

With only one type of train – Eurostar’s Siemens-built e320 - currently in production and authorized to work in the Channel Tunnel, and Siemens’ production lines fully occupied with a massive order for Germany’s Deutsche Bahn, Evolyn is looking to French transport giant Alstom and could use trains similar to the latest generation TGV-M.

Alstom has said it is so far merely in discussions with the new company.

With Alstom’s factory in La Rochelle also committed to building 100 TGV-Ms for French National Railway SNCF over the next 10 years, Evolyn’s chances of getting new trains designed, built and authorised in less than two years look very remote indeed.

To serve London, all three challengers face the same obstacles.

All will need to procure high-speed trains compatible with stringent Channel Tunnel fire regulations, as well as safety and power supply systems in up to five countries.

European rail commentator Jon Worth told CNN Travel: “Order trains from Siemens and maybe you get a new train through the tunnel by 2028, but more likely 2030.

“There is no fundamental reason why you could not build a TGV-M to be compatible with the Channel Tunnel fire regulations, but so far this has not been done – and you would need 12 months to get a redesign approved.”

Spanish train-builder Talgo offers a possible alternative. Its new “Avril” high-speed train, currently undertaking final testing in Spain and France, will be used on international services linking Madrid and Barcelona with French cities and has caught the eye of French open access hopefuls Le Train and Kevin Speed.

Talgo is likely to be in a position to deliver suitable high-speed trains sooner than Alstom, although it would also need to redesign Avril to meet Channel Tunnel rules and have the new variant approved by the tunnel regulator and infrastructure owners in France and the UK.

That’s a process likely to be measured in years rather than months, which means any new train would be delivered towards the end of this decade.

“And as if that is not all complex enough, new operators have the difficulty of finding paths [the timetabled slots allocated to each service], which is extremely complex, into busy stations such as Paris Gare du Nord, and terminal capacity due to onerous post-Brexit border checks,” adds Jon Worth.

“This is especially complex at [London’s] St Pancras, which has little room to expand passport and security facilities. Neither is insurmountable, but not at all easy.”

‘Bigger and better’

Arguably the most credible challenge to Eurostar is looming on routes unaffected by the political and operational issues stifling high-speed rail to London.

Italian Railways’ subsidiary QBuzz has applied to the Dutch Competition Authority for permission to operate Amsterdam-Brussels-Paris and Amsterdam-Cologne-Frankfurt (in competition with Germany’s Deutsche Bahn) using the superb Frecciarossa high-speed trains already deployed with great success in Italy, Spain and France.

QBuzz expects to open its new routes from January 2027.

In the last two years, Italy’s Trenitalia has made a huge impact on the Paris-Milan and Paris-Lyon routes, where the Frecciarossa competes directly with TGV. Since December 2021, passenger numbers on the Milan route have shot up by 58% while fares have fallen by an average of 7%.

“This new example and others, such as SNCF and Trenitalia competing with Spanish Railways, show how long-distance competition between incumbents is driving a modal shift to passenger rail,” says Nick Brooks, secretary general of ALLRAIL, a pressure group representing non-state train operators.

Europe aims to double high-speed rail use by 2030 – just six years away – and triple the current levels by 2050. Only a massive – and accelerated - expansion of the high-speed network can achieve these hugely ambitious targets.

Opening up existing high-speed railways to new operators will help to create new capacity and attract more passengers through new routes, lower costs and more journey opportunities, but the challenges involved should not be underestimated.

Alberto Mazzola, executive director of the Community of European Railways (CER) said his organization wants to see a high-speed rail network connecting all major cities, urban nodes and airports.

“With affordable and comfortable trains, rail will become the preferred mode of transport,” he told CNN Travel, stressing the need for all the European Union’s 27 countries to invest in high-speed rail.

“Our research clearly demonstrates the significant socio-economic and sustainability benefits of an EU-wide high-speed rail network,” he said. “At an estimated $800 billion, the long-term economic benefits will be substantially greater than the costs – an estimated $587 billion - and these connections would bring an exceptional increase of rail ridership and market share.”

ALLRAIL’s Brooks adds: “We want to see high-speed trains with 1,000 seats each connecting places around Europe on a frequent basis. This will lead to low fares and high revenue. While other competing long distance transport modes are setting themselves ‘net zero’ emission targets, rail can do it bigger and better.”'",sports,tennis
"'The state saw roughly a 5% increase in areas not currently in a drought.

Example video title will go here for this video

AUSTIN, Texas — As expected, the rainfall that fell just prior to Christmas has had a somewhat positive effect on our drought situation locally, as well as across the Lone Star State.

While we did not see much change in the Austin metro area, areas of the Hill Country and Williamson County did see some improvements.

Most notably, portions of Mason County, including the City of Mason, are now under ""abnormally dry"" conditions, which is down from the ""moderate"" drought category. In Williamson County, the northwest corner of the county is now in the ""severe"" drought category, which is down from the ""extreme"" category.

When looking at a statewide view of the drought, conditions have markedly improved, with all drought levels showing improving conditions. Most notably, north and east Texas, where most of the rain from the recent system fell, saw the biggest improvements statewide. The largest categorical improvement was in the ""abnormally dry"" category, where a five-percent decrease was observed. Additionally, areas not in a drought category increased by five percent as well. The ""moderate"" drought category also saw a large improvement, dropping by around 3.5% statewide.

With rain expected for the first week of 2024, we don't expect much change on the drought monitor for next Thursday's release, which will be the first of the new year. However, we'll be watching the monitor for January 11th, which will include next week's rainfall amounts.

Stick with KVUE for the latest as we track the potential for the drought to improve this winter with the El Nino pattern.

"'Taylor Swift postponed her famous Eras Tour in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after a 23-year-old fan died during her Friday night show. The Eras US tour, which began in Arizona in March and ended in Los Angeles in August, was credited with boosting local economies, increasing public transportation use, and generating a summer craze of friendship bracelets and girl power.

Swift's appearance in Brazil, however, turned sad before she ever took the stage, as concertgoers battled a punishing heatwave.

Deadly Heatwave in Brazil

The Brazilian Ministry of Culture announced that concertgoer 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides Machado had been in the heat at the venue when she ""suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest"" just before Swift's debut show in the city on Friday at the Nilson Santos stadium.

""We extend our solidarity to the friends and family of the young woman, certain that the investigation of the entire situation will be swift and accurate,"" said the press release.

The singer-songwriter has extended her sympathy to the fan.

""I'm not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it. I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil,"" Swift said in a handwritten note on Instagram.

Waters Not Allowed At The Venue

Seating for the Rio concerts is first-come, first-served, prompting some concertgoers to wait in lines outside the stadium-in the hot sun-for hours to obtain a spot inside.

Fans who attended the Friday event reported they were not allowed to bring water bottles inside the stadium, despite the fact that Rio and the rest of Brazil have been experiencing record-breaking temperatures this week as part of a deadly and long-lasting heat wave.

On Friday, the high temperature in Rio was 39.1 degrees Celsius (102.4 degrees Fahrenheit), but it seemed much hotter.

Elizabeth Morin, 26, who recently relocated to Rio from Los Angeles, described ""sauna-like"" circumstances.

""It was extremely hot. My hair got so wet from sweat as soon as I came in,"" she said. ""There was a point at which I had to check my breathing to make sure I wasn't going to pass out.""

The federal government stated that free water will now be accessible at concerts and other large events.

According to Justice Minister Flávio Dino on X, formerly known as Twitter, ""water bottles for personal use, in suitable material, will be allowed"" at concerts and festivals in Brazil coming ahead, and show producers must provide free and conveniently accessible drinking water.

Time For Fun, the Brazilian production company that organized Swift's Rio shows, issued a statement outlining new safety measures for the remaining shows, including allowing fans to bring in plastic water bottles, providing more water distribution points in and around the stadium, and providing more medical resources.

One of the biggest challenges for earthquake early warning systems (EEW) is the lack of seismic stations located offshore of heavily populated coastlines, where some of the world's most seismically active regions are located.

In a new study published in The Seismic Record, researchers show how unused telecommunications fiber optic cable can be transformed for offshore EEW.

Jiuxun Yin, a Caltech researcher now at SLB, and colleagues used 50 kilometers of a submarine telecom cable running between the United States and Chile, sampling seismic data at 8,960 channels along the cable for four days. The technique, called Distributed Acoustic Sensing or DAS, uses the tiny internal flaws in a long optical fiber as thousands of seismic sensors.

Yin and colleagues used the cable data to determine earthquake locations and estimate earthquake magnitudes for one onshore (magnitude 3.7) and two offshore (magnitude 2.7 and 3.3) earthquakes during the study period.

Their results show that using this single DAS array offers an approximate three-second improvement in earthquake early warning compared to onshore DAS arrays. In a simulation run by the researchers, they found that by deploying multiple DAS arrays spaced 50 kilometers apart and working together in the area, they could improve EEW alert times in the subduction zone by five seconds.

""While we did expect some improvements due to the offshore placement of the DAS array, the actual speed gains were beyond our initial projections,"" Yin said. ""The key advantage is the array's offshore location, which eliminates the need to wait for seismic waves to reach land-based stations.""

The region offshore from Chile is similar to that of the Cascadia region offshore from Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Both areas contain an active subduction zone, where tectonic plates collide and one plate plunges beneath another, causing some of history's largest and most destructive earthquakes. Even offshore of Southern California, numerous faults have hosted magnitude 6 or larger earthquakes. In all of these densely populated coastal areas, offshore earthquake early warning could help protect lives and property.

""The primary reason for selecting this cable is Chile's elevated seismic risk. The region experiences frequent offshore earthquakes and has been affected by several significant magnitude 8+ earthquakes in history, including the largest ever recorded in 1960,"" Yin explained. ""Given the high seismic risk and potentially devastating impacts of a large earthquake, there's a pressing need for a reliable offshore earthquake early warning system in Chile.""

The researchers used a deep learning artificial intelligence model, which is trained and validated on previous seismic and DAS data, to pick out the earthquake waves from the DAS data of this offshore cable. ""In the specific case of DAS, the volume of data collected is substantial. For real-time applications like EEW, pre-trained deep learning models provide a highly efficient and reliable option,"" Yin said. He noted, however, that other traditional seismological methods of picking earthquakes can still be effective in processing DAS data with automation.

Yin said researchers need more data, especially from larger magnitude earthquakes, to develop and test EEW algorithms effectively, as well as more information on how DAS instruments respond before building a real-time EEW system that integrates with existing EEW frameworks.

There are plenty of places around the world to continue this research, he noted.

""There are more than 1,500 cable landing stations around the globe, and the progress in the technology permits the use of operational cables and adding DAS systems without affecting [telecommunications] data transportation."" Yin said. ""We believe that this opens up a host of exciting research opportunities, and we are keen to explore these in future studies. We are looking for close interactions with cable owners, environmental agencies, and policymakers to scale the DAS-EEW for the benefit of coastal communities.""

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Three former Australian Open champions — Naomi Osaka, Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber — are set to return to Melbourne Park in January following maternity leave, joined by 2022 winner Rafael Nadal and hometown favorite Nick Kyrgios.

Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley told the tournament launch Wednesday that Nadal (left hip flexor) and Kyrgios (knee, wrist) are expected to return from major injuries in a bid to challenge Novak Djokovic’s dominance at Rod Laver Arena, where he has clinched 10 of his record 24 Grand Slam titles.

“Our 2022 champion Rafa Nadal has been working hard on his rehab for most of this year,"" Tiley said. “He always brings his best to Melbourne and no one can doubt how hard he competes. I’ve been in touch with his team and he’s now back on the court and looking forward to returning to Melbourne in January.""

Nadal has won two of his 22 Grand Slam titles in Melbourne — the first came in 2009.

“I appreciate the vote of confidence from the Australian Open… I am practising every day and working hard to come back asap,” Nadal wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

Tiley said Djokovic and No. 2-ranked Carlos Alcaraz are expected to lead the men's contingent, while leading players Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff are also expected to play in the women's draw.

The tournament will run from Jan. 14-28, with its opening day of play on a Sunday for the first time. The Australian Open joins the French Open as the only tennis majors to be held over 15 days.

"'Heading into this new NBA season, there has been a rash of domestic violence allegations against NBA players. In June 2022, the Charlotte Hornets’ Miles Bridges was arrested for an assault on the mother of his children. He was also charged with two felony counts of child abuse. He pleaded not guilty to said charges. As punishment, the NBA suspended Bridges for 30 games last season. As recently as last week, he was issued a criminal summons in regards to another domestic dispute in which he threw pool balls at a car in which the mother of his children and their children were inside. As of today, Bridges is still a member of the Charlotte Hornets franchise.

Kevin Porter Jr. is another player who got himself into a similar scenario. On Sept. 11, he was arrested after an alleged attack on his girlfriend and former WNBA player Kysre Gondrezick. He faces charges of second-degree strangulation and third-degree assault. This is also in the wake of one of the charges being dropped due to lack of evidence. It turned out what appeared to be a neck fracture as a result of the assault on Gondrezick, was really remanence from a congenital defect. Gondrezick has recently stated that their altercation is being made out to be more than what it really was.

Regardless of that, I thought it would be great to discuss these happenings and challenge the NBA. As of this week, Porter Jr. was traded from the Houston Rockets to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder are said to be waiving him, ESPN reported.

Conversely, Bridges agreed to a $7.9 million deal to stay with the Hornets this past summer. Seemingly it seems like Porter Jr.’s time in the NBA may be over, or he’ll have to earn his way back in. Bridges’ contract is guaranteed, regardless of whether or not the Hornets decide to keep him this season.

In both of these instances, we’re talking about multimillion-dollar athletes who have found themselves in situations the most common of people do. It seems that the NBA is a league of second chances. But what is the threshold for the NBA to be crossed, where they decide to fully cut ties? According to the Bleacher Report, former NBA player OJ Mayo was banned for two years by the NBA after testing positive for “drugs of abuse.” It’s been seven years, and we haven’t seen him return since.

I think that it’s tricky governing a sports league where you really can’t control one’s conduct. You can manage situations. You can set up parameters. But ultimately, it takes players to go along with said guidelines. So as a league, what should the NBA mandate to try and reprimand a player for such detrimental conduct? If a player is found guilty of committing harm in a domestic dispute, what does that mean for their contract? Should they be mandated to offer counseling for the abuser?

Much of what I’ve seen is that the NBA and their teams cooperate with authorities. And depending on the circumstance, a player’s total punishment is then levied. I often wonder what would help an abuser to be contrite. In the context of professional athletes, you’re already well off. If you lose your career, there are still ways to maintain the wealth you’ve amassed. But what is the root of said detrimental behavior? It’s a loaded question, and it may not have a singular response.

Regardless of the response, I think more should be done to reprimand abusive domestic behavior by NBA players. The types of cases I’ve highlighted prior are pretty serious. Involving the endangerment of children in these outbursts is crazy. Suspending someone for 30 games just doesn’t seem apropos. Hell, that’s not even half of an NBA season.

What I’d hate to see is a pattern of abuse form in the league that I love. These two cases spoken on today happened over the span of this past summer. In a perfect world, men won’t be actively abusing their partners. But there’s obviously a lack of self-control that is prevalent among us. There’s an unhealthy sense of self that these abusers have. In Bridge’s case, he certainly didn’t learn after his first offense. So, what now?

There’s a lot to consider. Job loss doesn’t totally seem to be on the table for all players. And I can see how mandating such a thing can be a slippery slope. Dana White was caught on camera slapping his wife, and business went along as usual, because of the prominent position he holds in the UFC.

All in all, NBA players are essentially walking commercials for the NBA. It can’t be great for the league to have players involved in violent altercations with women. It’s just my opinion, but league commissioner Adam Silver should speak, and recognize that he sees what has been happening. He has to admonish it. But above all, I’d hope these players’ teammates give them a good game and also hold them accountable. In a league that’s majority Black, it’s just a bad look. We have to be better about our conduct with women. I hope these fellas eventually grasp the errors of their ways.'",sports,basketball

The Aces opened Game 2 with a 19-2 run in the first four minutes, and that carried throughout the night with the Aces winning 104-76 over New York at Michelob Ultra Arena to take a 2-0 series lead in the finals.

Through two games of what was supposed to be the most highly anticipated WNBA Finals in league history, it’s the defending champions dominating at almost every facet. They have been the better team through six of eight quarters. They have slowed down Breanna Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu to the point of near ineffectiveness.

And now, the Aces will head to Brooklyn with a chance to win their second consecutive WNBA championship and put a cap on what can be deemed the greatest season in league history. Game 3 is Sunday at Barclays Center (noon, ESPN).

“The character of this team and their absolute buy-in to the person to their left or right’s success is authentic,” coach Becky Hammon said, “They don’t leave me speechless very often, but they executed defensively, offensively, sharing, everything we’ve been asking them to do.”

The Aces have made it well known that they like to play out of their defense. When they get stops and get going in transition, they’re unstoppable.

Funny enough, the game didn’t start with the Aces' defense. It began with a 3-pointer from Kelsey Plum, who opened with two makes from deep in the Aces’ first three baskets.

The storm kept hitting. Center Kiah Stokes, who hit five 3-pointers all regular season, hit two in the first three minutes. Jackie Young, coming off a 26-point outing in Game 1, also hit a three in that stretch. Stokes’ layup with 6:01 left in the opening frame capped off the incredible run.

The Aces scored a WNBA Finals record 38 points in the first quarter and led 38-19.

“Great defense, playing out of our defense, unselfish,” point guard Chelsea Gray said of how to describe the 19-2 run. “Our physicality went up another level at the start of the game.”

It’s uncommon for more than three players to sit at the postgame podium after a playoff game. The Aces had all five starters across one table, and each deserved to be up there.

A’ja Wilson finished with a game-high 26 points and 15 rebounds; Young proved Game 1 was no fluke with 24 points and eight rebounds; Plum once again remained in control of her offensive game with 23 points and eight assists; and Gray flashed moments of her shotmaking from last year’s run to being Finals MVP with 14 points and 11 assists. Stokes had eight points and seven rebounds in 29 minutes.

The Liberty regained form in the second quarter by cutting the once-22-point lead down to six. Las Vegas took a 52-44 lead into the break and were met with “profound” words from Hammon in the locker room.

In Game 1, the Aces turned it in their favor in the third quarter with a 26-16 edge thanks to the play of Young and Wilson. Game 2 was almost identical, but a much more dominant effort. The Aces outscored the Liberty 28-13 in the third with Young (11) and Wilson (10) once again leading the charge.

The Aces shot 58% in the third, while their defense kept the Liberty to just 31.2%.

“They’re the real deal,” Hammon said of her team’s character in the third. “Their competitiveness and their fight for each other, they’re a real team.”

The Aces had no answer in the first half from Liberty center Jonquel Jones; she had 19 points and 10 rebounds at halftime with seven of those rebounds coming from the offensive glass. Jones was held to three points in the second half.

Stewart, this year’s league MVP, finished with 14 points on 6 of 17 shooting. Ionescu, after going 2 of 7 in Game 1, was held to 2 of 10 in Game 2.

When the Aces and Liberty played each other four times between Aug. 6-28, it was during a stretch of 11 games in 22 days. The Aces were exhausted at the tail-end of that trip. Hammon knew coming back home that with rest, they would get back to their level of excellence.

Since coming back after that final regular season meeting in New York on Aug. 28, the Aces have not lost a game; four regular season games, and now seven straight in the playoffs. Only two have been decided by single digits.

The series is far from over, and the Aces know that. They were up 2-0 on Connecticut in last year’s finals and lost Game 3 by 29 points. The Aces answered three days later to win their first championship.

They head to what’s expected to be a raucous Barclays Center that has been a difficult environment for teams to play in. They’re also getting a Liberty team that will play with desperation with their season on the line.

The Aces are walking into a storm of their own. But they’re one win away from escaping it with another title.

“It was a great performance, and I hope the girls enjoy it tonight,” Hammon said. “That being said, my job is to keep us on the straight and narrow with the understanding we got thumped in their building twice. We’re going to come in with the appropriate respect, the appropriate focus and emotion for the moment.”

"'When Steve Carcarey tunes in to watch the National League Championship Series this week, he sees much more than two ballclubs vying for a spot in the World Series.

He sees an inspiration, in Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Christian Walker — and a longtime friend, who embodies what Norristown is all about.

“People don’t realize how hard this kid worked. People don’t know his background. Here’s a kid who won two national championships for the University of South Carolina. The kid’s a winner, everywhere he goes,” Carcarey said.

“And what I like the most about this young man is the persistence,” he said.

Times Herald readers may know Carcarey, the co-owner of Collegeville Italian Bakery, as a longtime baseball coach at Bishop Kenrick High School, Norristown Area Senior High School, Kennedy-Kenrick Catholic High School, Widener University and Mt. Carmel American Legion, and a 2022 inductee in the Montgomery County Coaches Hall of Fame. Readers may also remember Walker, the Diamondbacks’ first baseman who the Times Herald profiled in 2014, when Christian was playing with the Bowie Baysox, the Baltimore Orioles’ Double-A affiliate. He looked back at the 2003 season by Walker’s Section 5 champion Lower Perkiomen team that fell just shy of the Little League World Series.

“I’ve known Chris since he was 15 or 16 years old, and the way he’s transformed his body: he was a big guy in high school, he was just all power, and the way he takes care of himself now: he’s fit, and toned, and you just can’t say enough great things about this kid, and what he’s done on and off the field,” Carcarey said.

“I’m just happy that persistence paid off. He never gave up on himself. He’s living his dream, and I’m happy for him, and happy for his family,” he said.

Walker’s journey to the NLCS has been a long one: after being drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2009 following his senior year at Kennedy-Kenrick, Walker chose instead to play at the University of South Carolina, where the team played in the College World Series in each of his three years with the program, winning the title in his first two seasons. After being drafted again by the Baltimore Orioles in 2012, and a call-up in 2014 that produced his first big-league hit, Walker had a major obstacle to overcome as he navigated a series of waiver transactions as a minor league prospect: a big name, playing the same position, everywhere he went.

“When he first got drafted by the Orioles, he was behind an all-star: Chris Davis. Then he goes to the Braves, and he’s behind Freddie Freeman. Then he goes to the Reds, and he’s behind Joey Votto — and then he goes to the Diamondbacks, and he’s behind Paul Goldschmidt,” Carcarey said.

“Here’s a kid that could’ve said ‘I’m never gonna get a chance, I’ll never get an opportunity.’ But he got an opportunity, and look at him now: he’s a Gold Glove first baseman,” he said.

The Diamondbacks traded Goldschmidt after the 2018 season, opening a position for Walker that he’s held onto ever since, with over 140 games played at first base in three of the four full seasons since, and being named the league’s top-fielding first baseman just last year.

“People said he didn’t have a position, he can’t play at third base, he can’t play at first base. He made himself a Gold Glove first baseman. That’s what you see with this kid. He’s proven so many people wrong,” Carcarey said.

Throughout it all, he’s never forgotten his roots: Walker alternates winters in South Carolina and visiting family in the Norristown area, and never forgets to stop by the bakery. A November 2021 visit was proudly posted on the bakery’s Facebook page as Walker presented Carcarey with his Diamondbacks jersey, and in 2022 Christian’s mom, Julie, stopped by with a batch of homemade meatballs, which the bakery served with their fresh baked rolls and tomato pie.

“One time, we were sitting there talking with him, just a normal conversation, and he gets up. And I’m like, ‘Hold on, where are you going?’ He went outside, and got a bat, and saw a little boy at the bakery and gave it to him,” Carcarey said. “That’s the kind of guy he is. Here’s a guy who didn’t forget where he came from.”

Stop in the bakery — located at 3846 Ridge Pike in Collegeville, open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays, and offering special Phillies donuts this week — and you can see the “Walker Wall,” a display of Christian’s Diamondbacks jersey, a bat, and a photo, all signed by the bakery’s favorite player. No, Carcarey said, they won’t cover it up as Walker faces the Phillies.

“We’re proud, and honored, to display the Walker Wall with all his memorabilia on it. We’re so happy for him personally,” Carcarey said.

“Obviously we’re Phillies fans, obviously we want the Phillies to win, but we want Chris to be successful,” he said.

And it’s not the first time that Walker has matched up against Phillies superstar Bryce Harper: in a 2009 minor-league exhibition home run derby, still viewable on YouTube, Walker triumphed by pounding 19 homers into the empty stands of Tampa Bay’s Tropicana Field.

“They both used aluminum bats, and both of them were hitting absolute bombs with those bats, and I don’t know if anybody gave him a chance with Harper in that contest — and Walker ended up winning,” Carcarey said.

What can local kids learn from seeing one of their own on baseball’s biggest stage?

“He’s proven that you don’t give up on your dream. He’s been stuck behind how many all-star first basemen? He could’ve said ‘I’ll never get my shot,’ but Arizona stuck with him, and look what he’s done,” Carcarey said. “He’s put up monster numbers, and had a great year.”'",sports,baseball

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli forces severed northern Gaza from the rest of the besieged territory and pounded it with intense airstrikes overnight into Monday, as the Palestinian death toll from a month of fighting passed 10,000. An even bloodier phase is expected as Israeli troops push into the dense confines of Gaza City.

Palestinians held a mass funeral for dozens killed a day earlier in strikes in the south, where Israel has told civilians to seek refuge though it has continued to strike targets all across the coastal enclave.

Troops are expected to enter Gaza City soon, Israeli media reported, and Palestinian militants who have had years to prepare are likely to fight street by street, launching ambushes from a vast network of tunnels.

Casualties will likely rise on both sides in the war, which has already killed at least 10,022 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Some 1,400 Israelis have died, mostly civilians killed in the Oct. 7 incursion by Hamas that started the conflict. Both tolls are unprecedented in the decades-old conflict.

The Israeli military said late Sunday that it had cut off northern Gaza from the south, calling it a “significant stage” in the war. On Monday, it said that aircraft struck 450 targets overnight and ground troops took over a Hamas compound. A one-way corridor for residents to flee south remains available, according to the military, for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who remain in Gaza City and other parts of the north.

Some 1.5 million Palestinians, or around 70% of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes since the war began. Food, medicine, fuel and water are running low, and U.N.-run schools-turned-shelters are beyond capacity, with many sleeping on the streets outside.

Mobile phone and internet service went down overnight, the third territory-wide outage since the start of the war, but was gradually restored on Monday, according to the Palestinian telecom company Paltel and internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org. Aid workers say the outages make it even harder for civilians to seek safety or even call ambulances.

Israel has so far rejected U.S. suggestions for a pause in fighting to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries and the release of some of the estimated 240 hostages seized by Hamas in its raid. Israel has also dismissed calls for a broader cease-fire from increasingly alarmed Arab countries — including Jordan and Egypt, which made peace with it decades ago.

After days of intense diplomacy around the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up his tour of the region on Monday, saying efforts to secure a humanitarian pause, negotiate the release of hostages and plan for a post-Hamas Gaza were still “a work in progress” without pointing to any concrete achievements.

The war has also stoked wider tensions, with Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group trading fire along the border. In another sign of growing unrest, a Palestinian man stabbed and wounded two members of Israel’s paramilitary Border Police in east Jerusalem before being shot dead, according to police and an Associated Press reporter at the scene.

Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with Gaza and the West Bank, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital.

In northern Gaza, a Jordanian military cargo plane air-dropped medical aid to a field hospital, King Abdullah II said early Monday. It appeared to be the first such airdrop of the war, raising the possibility of another avenue for aid delivery besides Egypt’s Rafah crossing, which has so far been the only entry point.

Over 450 trucks carrying aid have been allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt since Oct. 21, but humanitarian workers say it’s insufficient to meet mounting needs in the territory, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.

Northern Gaza is facing a severe water shortage, as there is no fuel to pump from municipal wells and Israel shut off the region’s main line. The U.N. office for humanitarian affairs said seven water facilities across Gaza were struck over the last two days and sustained “major damage,” raising the risk of sewage flooding. Israel has restored two water pipelines in central and southern Gaza, the U.N. said.

Some 800,000 people have heeded Israeli military orders to flee to southern Gaza. Some 2,000 people, many carrying only what they could hold in their arms, walked down Gaza’s main north-south highway on Sunday. “The children saw tanks for the first time. Oh world, have mercy on us,” said one Palestinian man, who declined to give his name.

But Israeli bombardments have continued across the territory, and strikes in central and southern Gaza — the purported safe zone — killed dozens of people on Sunday. Israel blames civilian casualties on Hamas, accusing the militants of operating in residential neighborhoods.

On Monday, Palestinians held a mass funeral for 66 people outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. The bodies were wrapped in white sheets on the ground outside the hospital morgue. A man with bandages wrapped around his head placed his hand on a child’s body and wept.

Meanwhile, four civilians were killed by an Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in south Lebanon late Sunday, including three children, a local civil defense official and state-run media reported. The Israeli military said it was reviewing the strike, after initially saying it had struck Hezbollah targets following anti-tank fire that killed an Israeli civilian. Hezbollah said it fired Grad rockets from southern Lebanon into Israel in response.

In the overnight strikes in Gaza, the Israeli military said it had killed a senior Hamas militant, identified as Jamal Mussa, who had allegedly carried out a shooting attack against Israeli soldiers in Gaza in 1993.

It said 30 Israeli troops have been killed since the ground offensive began over a week ago. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, disrupting daily life even as most are intercepted or fall in open areas. Tens of thousands of Israelis have evacuated from communities near the volatile borders with Gaza and Lebanon.

"'A paper just out now in PNAS by Noah Diffenbaugh, Daniel Swain, and Danielle Touma shows that ""Anthropogenic warming has increased drought risk in California."" From the abstract:

... We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100% probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.

Michael Mann and Peter Gleick have written a commentary for PNAS to accompany that research. The graphic at the top of the post is from that study. They note:

California is experiencing extreme drought. Measured both by precipitation and by run- off in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins, 10 of the past 14 y have been below normal, and the past 3 y have been the driest and hottest in the full instrumental record. A plot of temperature and precipitation anom- alies over the full instrumental record from 1895 through November 2014 shows that the 3-y period ending in 2014 was by far the hottest and driest on record (Fig. 1). As of the publication of this commentary, the state appears headed into a fourth consec- utive year of water shortfall, leading to massive groundwater overdraft, cutbacks to farmers, reductions in hydroelectricity gen- eration, and a range of voluntary and man- datory urban water restrictions.

A number of studies have examined the California drought to try to determine if it was ""caused by"" (or otherwise affected by) human greenhouse gas pollution. These studies vary in their level of attribution, but increasingly it is becoming clear that anthropogenic global warming has a very big hand in this.

Mann and Gleick tackle the problem of defining drought. There are multiple ways to do so, and they relate to different causes. The plethora of definitions and relevant variables allows for a given study to miss any global warming effect by picking certain factors and ignoring others. Studies that look mainly at inputs to the hydrological system (i.e., rainfall) tend to miss the output part of the equation, including evaporation, which is exacerbated by a warming climate. Mann and Gleick point out that the Diffenbaugh study adds significant weight to the idea that anthropogenic climate change has increased the frequency, magnitude, and duration of California's droughts. Perhaps more importantly, the Diffenbaugh study suggests ""the emergence of a climatic regime in which all future dry years coincide with warmer conditions.""

Gleick told me, ""The scientific evidence showing the growing influence of climate changes on extreme events around the world, including the ongoing California drought, continues to pile up. The clearest piece of this is the record high, and increasing, temperatures, which directly influence the availability and demand for water, but there is also growing evidence that climate change is influencing pressure dynamics and atmospheric circulation patterns that either bring, or divert, water from the west coast of the United States.""

So, the current drought in California is linked to human induced climate change, and in the future, this will be a more common phenomenon than it has in the base, according to the best available science. But what about other effects of climate change? I asked Michael Mann about the relationship between California Drought and his recent study showing that we should soon be entering a period (over the next couple of decades) during which heat that has been hiding in the oceans will be leaving it's watery milieu and joining us up here on the surface. He told me, ""Here is the linkage I think is most relevant: the “faux pause”, in our recent study, was closely tied to the predominance of La Nina-like conditions in the tropical Pacific for a large part of the past decade, and these same conditions are closely linked with California drought (La Nina years tend to be drought years in California, while El Nino years tend to be wet years—though this doesn’t necessarily hold true for every single event). So one might imagine that a return to a greater tendency for El Nino-like conditions in the tropical Pacific over the next decade or two (which would spell an end to the “Faux Pause”) could actually be a mitigating effect as far as California drought is concerned. A bit counter-intuitive, but that’s best assessment here.""'",climate,drought

With the clock winding down and the tension in the stadium reaching a fever pitch on Monday night, it was clear that the high-stakes clash between the San Francisco 49ers and the Minnesota Vikings would be decided by a single, pivotal moment.

With just 33 seconds left on the clock, the crowd held its collective breath as 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy dropped back to make the throw that could change the game’s destiny. But soon after, Vikings defensive back Camryn Bynum swiftly slid through the football field with unwavering focus and lightning-quick reflexes as the ball soared through the air.

And then it happened — a spectacular catch! Bynum seized victory from the jaws of defeat after making a game-altering interception. As the U.S. Bank Stadium erupted in a deafening roar of triumph for the Vikings’ thrilling 22-17 victory, Bynum fell to the ground and celebrated the moment with the worm dance.

“Everytime we got the flag out, we gotta ball out,” Bynum said as he pointed to the Philippine flag on his football helmet .“Salamat sa inyong suporta, all my kababayans. [Thank you for your support, all my compatriots.]”

Bynum, the 25-year-old proud Filipino American NFL star, has never shied away from bringing his Filipino pride to the field. Often with the Philippine flag draped over his shoulders, Bynum always mentions his love and gratefulness for his fellow Filipinos.

The football player was born to an African American father and a third-generation Filipino American mother, whose family traces its roots to Leyte in the Eastern Visayas region of the Philippines. Growing up with a mixed cultural background in Southern California, he emphasizes the advantage of his diverse upbringing, learning about various cultures and playing different sports.

In the fourth grade, Bynum eventually fell in love with football and knew he wanted to become a professional player. “Ever since then, it's been my passion,” Bynum tells NextShark.

He would go on to become an impact player for the Golden Bears in 2017 before he was drafted by the Vikings in 2021. But it wasn’t until his first visit to the Philippines that he truly found his purpose and motivation in playing the sport.

In June, Bynum and several of his family members traveled to the Philippines after Typhoon Megi pummeled through the nation two months earlier, killing over 200 residents and displacing over 300,000. In his first-ever visit to the country, he and his family focused on aiding the island of Leyte. Seeing the resilience and witnessing the heart of the Filipino people changed Bynum's mindset.

“Making something out of nothing and how grateful everybody is just really the heart of the Filipino,” Bynum says. “I think that shaped me as a person and as a player. When I'm on the field, I really have a bigger reason to play knowing that I can really change people's lives. My main motivation now is to bring everything back to the people and to help other people.”

After participating in relief efforts and learning how typhoons are a frequent occurrence in the Philippines, Bynum decided it was essential to raise awareness and provide consistent support for affected communities. Earlier this year, the football player founded the Bynum Faith Foundation (BFF), a nonprofit organization committed to providing relief and community outreaches to struggling communities in the U.S. and in the Philippines.

Bynum's wife's church, New Life Church, in the Philippines, and their foundation, New Life Community Care Foundation, laid the framework for Bynum’s own philanthropic efforts. He explains that BFF's mission is not just to offer one-time assistance, but to adopt entire communities and help them recover and rebuild for the long term. He highlights assessing the ongoing needs of the communities they work with, ensuring that they receive support throughout the entire recovery process.

“It was my great grandma's hometown that got hit,” Bynum shares. “And that's where we were able to do our first outreach and that kind of hit home for me. So being able to see that and start the foundation meant a lot because now we're able to go back and really help put communities back on their feet.”

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bynum Faith Foundation (@bynumfaithfoundation)

Besides uplifting Filipinos on the field and through outreach projects, Bynum has also committed himself to the mission to bring American football to the Philippines. During his past off-season visit, he discovered a small community of football fans in the Philippines, where most citizens do not play or follow the sport. Inspired by the community's dedication to the sport, he felt compelled to help them and use his platform to spread football to new parts of the world. Bynum has since established a football training camp that he calls “Camp Beezy.”

“It’s not big yet and it might be tough, but in the next few years, I think we can really make it blow up,” he says. “And now you see that flag football is going to the Olympics, so in my mind, I'm thinking, we have five years to train all of my friends out there in the Philippines, and we're gonna try and qualify for the Olympics on the flag football team.”

In the time he has spent teaching the sport in the East Asian nation, Bynum said he has seen a rapid growth of interest in football among young athletes, noting that some of his friends had formed teams and were even participating in international tournaments.

“I just want people to give it a try. Every single person that's tried it has ended up falling in love with it…So it's super inspiring to me. It helps me really change the way I look at football. It makes me more grateful to be playing in the NFL because I see how much it inspires them,” Bynum shares.

The 25-year-old has intentions to expand Camp Beezy by collaborating with local organizations and schools in the Philippines, with a focus on intramural teams within universities. “As soon as I get back, it's going to be even bigger,” he promises.

For the upcoming off-season, Bynum is organizing three football camps: the first camp will be in Cebu, the second in Manila and the third in Japan. His goal is to continue growing football's presence in the region, particularly focusing on different cities and islands to expand the sport's popularity. Alongside the football camps, his foundation also plans to incorporate outreach activities, utilizing the manpower and resources available during the camps to make a positive impact on the local communities.

Throughout Bynum’s career in football and philanthropy, he emphasizes the importance of prioritizing his faith, keeping Jesus Christ in the center as his guiding force. Bynum also urges his supporters to embody the Filipino spirit of hard work and resilience, emphasizing the significance of determination in facing life’s challenges. He highlights the value of remaining grateful, whether one has a lot or a little, recognizing that everything is a blessing.

“Just know that when I'm on the field, it's bigger than me,” Bynum says. “There's a bigger purpose to all of this. I don't want any of this fame for myself. I want to give it all back to God and to other people.”

A Quick Take On Tremor International

Tremor International Ltd (NASDAQ:TRMR) reported its Q3 2023 financial results on November 22, 2023, producing year-over-year revenue growth of 13.0%.

The firm operates an online advertising platform for both the buy side and sell side of the market.

I previously wrote about Tremor with a Hold outlook due to revenue challenges amid an advertising industry slump.

Given the results of my discounted cash flow calculation indicating Tremor International Ltd stock is fully valued at its current price of around $3.90 and no foreseeable jump in advertising activity or revenue in the near term, my outlook on Tremor remains Neutral [Hold] at this time.

Tremor International Overview And Market

Israel-based Tremor has developed a platform that helps advertisers and website owners buy and sell online advertising capacity via its automated marketplace.

The firm is led by CEO Ofer Druker, who has been with Tremor since November 2017 and was previously CEO of Matomy Media Group.

The company’s primary capabilities include:

DSP - Demand Side Platform

DMP - Data Management Platform

SSP - Supply Side Platform

Commentary On Tremor International

In its last earnings call (Source - Seeking Alpha), covering Q3 2023’s results, management’s prepared remarks highlighted the hiring of a new Chief Marketing Officer and completing the rebranding of its products to Nexxen. The company will likely change its name to Nexxen (NEXN) after a shareholder vote in December.

Management has noted increasing conversations with linear advertising executives about shifting further to digital platforms.

So, the company is optimistic that its future growth in CTV (Connected TV) will be fueled by this trend and its ability to serve cross-platform requirements.

Also, leadership has fully integrated its Amobee acquisition, which is powering its Nexxen Discovery business intelligence offering, enabling customers to perform audience discovery, cross-screen planning, activation and measurement in one place.

Regarding the conflict in Israel, the firm generates more than 85% of its revenue contribution ex-TAC from the U.S., where its largest base of employees is situated. Certain Israel-based employees have been called up to active duty, so the firm may have some risk if the conflict widens.

The company is also planning to authorize a $20 million share repurchase program in the near future.

I prepared a chart showing the frequency of keywords and terms mentioned by analysts and management on the most recent conference call:

Seeking Alpha

The chart shows a high frequency of negative terms such as ""uncertain,"" ""challenge,"" ""headwind"" and ""macro.""

Analysts questioned the leadership about the macro environment, partnership strategy and the shift from linear to digital.

Management said it is seeing stabilization of the macro environment in Q4, but guidance has been cautious due to uncertainty around deals being able to close by year-end.

The company is pursuing partnerships that provide increased capabilities and market reach.

Leadership believes the shift from linear to digital TV will happen over the next 3 - 5-year period and believes the company is well-positioned to take advantage of this shift due to its integration of Amobee, creating a cross-platform solution.

For the quarter’s results, total revenue for Q3 2023 rose by 13.0% YoY, and gross profit grew by 2.3%, both positive results.

Selling and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue fell by 2.3% year-over-year, but operating income dropped to negative $3.4 million for the quarter.

The company's financial position is strong, with plenty of liquidity, a smaller amount of long-term debt and strong free cash flow.

TRMR’s Rule of 40 performance has been poor and has deteriorated sequentially into negative territory.

Looking ahead, consensus revenue growth estimates for 2023 suggest a decline of about 2% versus 2022.

This would be about the same revenue decline rate as 2022 versus 2021.

In the past twelve months, the firm's EV/Sales valuation multiple has fallen significantly, as the chart from Seeking Alpha shows below:

Seeking Alpha

Given the results of my discounted cash flow calculation indicating the stock is fully valued at its current price of around $3.90 and no foreseeable jump in advertising activity or revenue in the near term, my outlook on Tremor International Ltd is Neutral [Hold] at this time.'",climate,earthquake
"'FIEL – A fisherman walks across a dry patch of land in the marshes in Dhi Qar province, Iraq, Sept. 2, 2022. The three-year drought that has left millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Iran with little water wouldn’t have happened without human-caused climate change, according to a new study on Wednesday, Nov. 8, 2023. (AP Photo/Anmar Khalil, File)

A three-year drought that has left millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Iran with little water wouldn’t have happened without human-caused climate change, a new study found.

The west Asian drought, which started in July 2020, is mostly because hotter-than-normal temperatures are evaporating the little rainfall that fell, according to a flash study Wednesday by a team of international climate scientists at World Weather Attribution.

Without the world warming 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-19th century, “it would not be a drought at all,” said lead author Friederike Otto, an Imperial College of London climate scientist.

It’s a case of climate change unnaturally intensifying naturally dry conditions into a humanitarian crisis that has left people thirsty, hungry and displaced, concluded the research, which has not yet undergone peer review but follows scientifically valid techniques to look for the fingerprints of global warming.

The team looked at temperatures, rainfall and moisture levels and compared what happened in the last three years to multiple computer simulations of the conditions in a world without human-caused climate change.

“Human-caused global climate change is already making life considerably harder for tens of millions of people in West Asia,” said study co-author Mohammed Rahimi, a professor of climatology at Semnan University in Iran. “With every degree of warming Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harder places to live.”

Computer simulations didn’t find significant climate change fingerprints in the reduced rainfall, which was low but not too rare, Otto said. But evaporation of water in lakes, rivers, wetlands and soil “was much higher than it would have been’’ without climate change-spiked temperatures, she said.

In addition to making near-normal water conditions into an extreme drought, study authors calculated that the drought conditions in Syria and Iraq are 25 times more likely because of climate change, and in Iran, 16 times more likely.

Kelly Smith, assistant director of the U.S. National Drought Mitigation Center in Nebraska, who was not part of the study, said the research made sense.

Drought is not unusual to the Middle East region and conflict, including Syria’s civil war, makes the area even more vulnerable to drought because of degraded infrastructure and weakened water management, said study co-author Rana El Hajj of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre in Lebanon.

“This is already touching the limits of what some people are able to adapt to,” Otto said. “As long as we keep burning fossil fuels or even give out new licenses to explore new oil and gas fields these kinds of events will only get worse and keep on destroying livelihoods and keeping food prices high. And this is not just a problem for some parts of the world, but really a problem for everyone.”

"'CHARLESTON COUNTY, S.C. (WCSC) - A Johns Island elementary school is unveiling a new installation that will support students in reaching their greatest potential.

Angel Oak Elementary School will hold a ceremony Saturday morning to commemorate the first Wise Owl House installation.

The Wise Owl House project began in early 2023 as a part of the School Improvement Council’s effort to bolster student achievement by expanding access to free learning materials, ranging from books to learning kits designed specifically for children from birth to the age of five. These kits will come with educational activities for families, developmental milestone guides and various other materials that will allow learning to begin early at home. These kits were designed by teachers at Angel Oak with the support of the Charleston County School District Early Learning Department.

The Wise Owl House project was initially created to install these free miniature libraries in “key, accessible areas on Johns and Wadmalaw Islands,” however, the program was met with such positive reception and enthusiasm that it has since become an official 501(c)(3) effort aimed at sustaining Wise Owl Houses not only on these islands, but throughout the greater Charleston area. This organization is now known as Wise Owl House Incorporated.

Saturday’s unveiling ceremony for the very first of these installations will be held at 9 a.m. at the Barrier Island Little League Ballfield, located at 3362 Maybank Highway.

More information about the project and a link to donate or request a learning kit can be found on the Wise Owl House website.

"'This story is part of Nature’s 10, an annual list compiled by Nature’s editors exploring key developments in science and the individuals who contributed to them.

While temperatures soared and wildfires raged through the forests of Greece this July, Eleni Myrivili watched with horror from her home in Athens. “This is the type of devastation that you can’t really replace,” she says. “And this is clearly a catastrophe that we are responsible for.”

Nature’s 10: read the 2023 list

Myrivili, a former deputy mayor of Athens, now has a global role working to mitigate the catastrophic impacts of the warming climate. She is the first United Nations chief heat officer — and has a remit to keep people cool as the planet boils.

This July broke unofficial records for the hottest average global temperatures on a single day and month, and 2023 will almost certainly be the hottest year on record by the end of December. That extreme heat is taking a deadly toll. As just one example, a paper published in July estimated that heatwaves in Europe in 2022 killed more than 61,000 people between the end of May and early September, with Italy, Greece and Spain seeing the highest heat-related mortality rates (J. Ballester et al. Nature Med. 29, 1857–1866; 2023).

Myrivili’s focus on heat is a long way from the start of her career as a cultural anthropologist. She got a PhD studying immigration, violence and borderlands, specializing in the region where Albania, North Macedonia and Greece meet. She then started teaching at the University of the Aegean in Μytilene, Greece. In summer 2007, parts of the country ignited in flames and much of Parnis National Park near Athens burned. “All of us who work in climate change have these moments where you kind of wake up to the reality of climate change,” she says. “For me, it was 2007.”

Angered by the lack of information and advice about the fires, Myrivili decided to go into politics. After a stint working with a Greek green political party, she read the 2013 book If Mayors Ruled the World by Benjamin R. Barber and decided to pivot to city government.

Taking various positions in Athens’s government, she worked to infuse climate resilience and planning across city departments. When she became head of the parks department, she changed her title to chief of urban nature, resilience and climate-change adaptation to underscore what she saw as her focus. In 2021, she was named chief heat officer for Athens in a wave of such appointments in various cities, organized by the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht–Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center in Washington DC.

To raise awareness of deadly weather patterns, Myrivili kicked off the practice in Greece of naming heatwaves. She also worked to secure funding for climate initiatives; in 2018, her team landed a €5-million loan (US$5.9 million at the time) from the European Investment Bank for climate-adaptation projects, including planting green spaces in Athens.

Myrivili’s hard work and connections made her effective at gaining traction in city government, says Elissavet Bargianni, who succeeded Myrivili as the Athens chief heat officer earlier this year. “A lot of people have trust in her,” Bargianni says. “She can take something that may seem impossible and find a way to make it possible.”

Now, Myrivili is focused on raising awareness of extreme heat at the global level, and on securing money for projects through the auspices of UN Habitat, the programme that works towards making cities sustainable. That includes a global-cooling pledge introduced at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai this month. It aims to support the development and roll-out of cooling technologies that do not add to greenhouse-gas emissions.

Just don’t mention air conditioning to Myrivili, who hates it for its climate impacts. But during a heatwave in 2021, she finally bought a small air-conditioning unit for her bedroom. “I still hate it,” she says.

And yet the use of air conditioners is only going to grow as temperatures climb. That’s one of the reasons Myrivili was at the Dubai climate negotiations that are trying to stop the world from burning — and aiming to prepare for what’s to come.'",climate,heatwave
"'As Bong Joon-ho said a few years back when accepting his Golden Globe for Parasite, “Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” In the years since Parasite won not only the International Feature Oscar but Best Picture, more international films have continued to break through to the ceremony’s biggest categories.

But the International Feature category remains an imperfect vessel for showcasing non-American films to American audiences. Of the 88 films (half of which I’ve seen) submitted from around the globe, the Academy shortlisted just 15 (seen them all!), which are now eligible for a nomination. Because of the Academy’s rule that only one film per country may be submitted to compete in the category, some of the year’s very best international films won’t actually compete for that Oscar.

So what were the year’s best international films? Here’s my list, a mix of the best of what the Academy shortlisted and might nominate—as well as the best of what they didn’t…

La Chimera

The greatest victim this year of the Academy’s one-film-per-country rule is one of the year’s best films from anywhere on the globe, Alice Rohrwacher’s masterpiece fable La Chimera. With The Crown’s Josh O’Connor at its center, the film follows a gang of tombaroli—grave robbers who unearth Etruscan tombs in order to sell the sacred artifacts buried inside. Rohrwacher crafts something bespoke and gloriously tactile (you can all but smell the dirt that peppers O’Connor’s fashionably filthy cream suit) while interweaving slippery themes of love, death, and moral gray areas born out of economic need. Italy instead chose to submit Matteo Garrone’s Venice-winner Io Capitano, an expansive but cliched migrant story with a great lead performance by young actor Seydou Sarr. That film was shortlisted.

Anatomy of a Fall

Another casualty of the one-film-per-country rule is also this year’s Palme d’Or winner at the Cannes Film Festival. Justine Triet’s courtroom drama about a German novelist suspected of killing her French husband has been one of the most talked about arthouse films all year, aided by Sandra Hüller’s engrossing and inscrutable lead performance. France’s decision to not select the film could be a strategic one—roughly half of the film is in English—but no matter: It still is in play for Best Picture, Director, and Original Screenplay, along with Hüller’s bona fide shot at Best Actress.

The Taste of Things

France instead chose another Cannes prize winner (Best Director for French-Vietnamese maestro Trần Anh Hùng), The Taste of Things, and it’s a shrewd and mouthwatering film. Juliette Binoche and Benoît Magimel play a 19th-century cook and restaurateur whose years-long professional relationship has evolved into a will-they-or-won’t-they romantic flirtation. The cooking sequences are so meticulous and thrilling that it feels more like you are watching a bank heist movie, but its melancholy romance makes The Taste of Things among the likeliest to satisfy not only a wide audience (your parents are going to love it), but the Academy. If that happens, it will be France’s first win in over 30 years. I guess it might only take a little food porn.

Perfect Days

Instead of Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron or the devastating Cannes winner Monster, Japan selected German director Wim Wenders’ Perfect Days, which follows the everyday trials of a kindhearted Tokyo toilet cleaner played by Kōji Yakusho. While it frequently teeters towards becoming too precious and cutesy in its appreciation of everyday human interaction, its protagonist’s internal tug-of-war between the life he chose for himself and the one that might have been is quite moving. With its warmheartedness and bursting soundtrack of familiar songs from the likes of Nina Simone and Lou Reed, the film has winning potential—though in a perfect world, Kōji Yakusho would be among the Best Actor contenders, as well.

The Delinquents

Argentina’s Oscar submission follows two bank employees: Morán, who steals a small fortune large enough to abandon the prison of everyday life once he finishes the short jail sentence for his crime, and Román, the coworker whom Morán tasks to keep watch over his half of the money. What follows is a funny but not fatalistic musing on the confines we make for ourselves and how freedom can be its own cage. Clearly the Academy wasn’t on board for this three-hour existential comedy and it missed the shortlist, but trust me on this one: adventurous viewers will find it to be one of the year’s most exquisite movies.

Afire

Christian Petzold’s Afire is a tragicomic Rohmer homage, following a writer as he works on the manuscript for a terrible novel (hilariously titled “Club Sandwich”) at his friend’s family home. Challenging him with unexpected guests and an encroaching forest fire, the film is a slim but densely observed study of self-absorption, and is unexpectedly sexy. Germany instead chose the shortlisted The Teachers’ Lounge, a slightly muddled allegory on our fragile social order, but a likely nominee given its enthusiastic response by critics.

Godland

Godland follows a Danish priest who ventures into remote 19th-century Iceland to establish a church in the then-Danish territory, with the danger and psychological isolation along the way presenting a cinematically breathtaking perspective on the futility of religious colonialism. Gorgeously unsparing in its depiction of the harsh landscape (if you told me someone died making this movie, I would believe you!), the film is a mix between Days of Heaven and The Revenant in its punishing visual rapture.

Omen

In Omen, a man returns to Congo with his pregnant Belgian wife at her insistence, reuniting him with the mother who rejected him under suspicions of witchcraft. What follows is a bold, visually thrilling examination of tradition and superstition, expanding its story beyond its protagonist to an ensemble of characters that show that family, home, and community are not the haven that social orders define them to be. Belgium submitted the film but it missed the shortlist.

Tótem

The sophomore feature from Mexican director Lila Avilés, Tótem is a free-flowing and incredibly moving family drama, and in my estimation, the absolute best film advancing in the International Feature race. Told largely through the eyes of 7-year-old Sol, the film witnesses a celebration for Sol’s father as the family prepares for his imminent death, charting the shift in Sol and her loved ones as their bond prepares to irrevocably change. With storytelling so potently alive, Avilés is a talent to keep our eyes on—one that the Academy will hopefully recognize this year.

The Mother of All Lies

In an audacious blend of documentary, fictionalized elements, and pseudo-animation, The Mother of All Lies powerfully reflects on how a single home or nation can contain multiple perspectives on politics and the past. Moroccan debut director Asmae El Moudir creates a clay model workshop to explore her family’s history and political context, resulting in an unforgettable reckoning with her grandmother Zahra, who forbade any family photos and conversation on past events. One of many non-fiction films that were submitted for the International Feature category, Mother missed the Documentary Feature shortlist, but made it onto the shortlist for International Feature.

Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World

There isn’t a movie I’ve seen all year that has broken as many movie rules as this, Romanian director Radu Jude’s follow-up to COVID-era Berlin winner Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn. At a sprawling and unpredictable 163 minutes, Jude presents gig worker Angela as she drives around interviewing candidates for a corporately produced work safety video and performing as a caustic alter ego on social media. With cameos from Tár’s Nina Hoss and reviled genre director Uwe Boll, the film wildly balances whiplash-inducing gonzo laughs with dead serious rage for corporate oppression. We did not expect Do Not Expect to entice squarer Oscar voters, and alas, its brashness was left off the shortlist.

Goodbye Julia

Among the films that played Cannes’ Un Certain Regard sidebar this year, Goodbye Julia tracks the relationship between two women on either side of Sudan’s northern and southern divide, one of whom is secretly responsible for the death of the other’s husband. If the premise sounds like a potentially manipulative polemic à la Crash, Mohamed Kordofani’s debut film instead delivers a delicate and complex character drama, one that will hopefully resonate with viewers amidst Sudan’s ongoing conflict—even though it didn’t make the Oscar shortlist.

The Zone of Interest

British auteur Jonathan Glazer’s adaptation of Martin Amis’ novel about the commandant of Auschwitz and his domestic life adjacent to the death camp has been one of the most discussed films of the year, ever since its Grand Prix-winning Cannes debut. Glazer is not typically an artist suited to the Academy’s taste (he previously made the brilliant but bizarre Scarlett Johansson alien film Under the Skin), but this controversial and formalist stunner may be hard to deny. Anatomy’s Hüller is also excellent in the film, and like Anatomy, Glazer’s film could show up in Best Picture and Director. However, much like the aforementioned Omen and Perfect Days, the multinational film—a Polish/U.K. production shot in the German language, but submitted by the U.K.—reflects the somewhat arbitrariness of the Academy’s process of having films submitted by a single country.

About Dry Grasses

Look, I can hear your groans about the growing number of long films on this list, but noted maker of butt-numbing marathon movies Nuri Bilge Ceylan has made yet another one that is worth your time! His Cannes winner About Dry Grasses follows two Anatolian teachers accused of inappropriate behavior and another teacher who becomes romantically involved with one of them. Its sprawling, dense conversations are trademark Ceylan, and its three-plus hour runtime rewards with visual austerity and a deep well of philosophical and character detail.

Fallen Leaves

Among the most widely respected and safest bets to be nominated by the Academy is Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki’s Fallen Leaves. A deadpan romantic comedy about a lonely grocery worker who begins a relationship with an equally lonely alcoholic, lead Alma Pöysti earned a surprise Best Actress nomination by the typically star-hungry Golden Globes. The enthusiasm for the film may be a little lost on me, but if nothing else, consider this respite from the lengthier films I’ve offered elsewhere: Fallen Leaves clocks in at just 80 minutes.

Other films of interest that made the International Feature shortlist: Spain’s Society of the Snow is Netflix’s contender, a retelling of the Uruguayan flight disaster previously sensationalized in Alive, is handsomely made but doesn’t make us feel we’ve learned much new from a story we already know; Bhutan’s Pawo Choyning Dorji might again be nominated for The Monk and the Gun, after his surprise nominee Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom a few years ago; Mads Mikkelsen’s star power could fuel the flat, soggy The Promised Land from Denmark, also directed by a previous nominee Nicolaj Arcel; Life is Beautiful-esque Amerikatsi from Armenia; and powerful films also shortlisted for Documentary Feature Four Daughters and 20 Days in Mariupol.'",climate,heatwave
"'Electrifying music concerts and other mass events are increasingly under threat from severe weather events, such as extreme heat.

The tragic incident at a Taylor Swift concert in Brazil recently, which resulted in the death of one fan, is a stark reminder of what can happen.

The concert took place in a stadium during a heatwave. Fans lined up for hours outside the Rio de Janeiro venue, with temperatures reportedly over 40°C. With the high humidity, this would have felt like almost 60°C, according to a measure known as the ""heat index"".

As well as the fatality, fans reported burns after touching hot metal floors and railings.

There have been other similar events

What happened at the Swift concert is the consequence of insufficient preparation for extreme weather conditions during a large-scale event. However, this is not an isolated case. There is a long list of mass gatherings and events affected by extreme weather in 2023.

In August, a Beyoncé concert in a Washington DC stadium took place during severe weather conditions. This time it was heavy rain and lightning. Attendees were ordered to shelter in place.

Lightning posed a direct threat to their safety. Those inside the stadium were directed to shelter under covered areas and ramps. Afterwards, several fans were reportedly treated for heat exhaustion.

The directive to shelter in place could have led to overcrowding in covered areas, potentially increasing the risk of incidents, such as a crowd crush.

Another US example was Ed Sheeran's concert at a Pittsburgh stadium during a July heatwave.

Some 17 people were hospitalised. Health emergencies included heat exhaustion and two cardiac arrests (when the heart stops beating).

We must prepare

Climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and intense. So risk assessments should include detailed weather monitoring and structural assessments for outdoor set-ups to ensure shade structures, for instance, can cope with crowds.

Contingency plans for a rapid response are also needed. These need to include plans to supply water or protective equipment (such as plastic ponchos) and timely safety directions and information.

Such planning should encompass not just the likelihood of extreme weather but also its potential impact on infrastructure, crowd control and emergency medical responses.

Artists play a role too

While the primary onus of safety lies with event organisers and venues, artists can also play a significant role in public safety during extreme weather. So we need to keep them informed about identified potential risks and planned countermeasures.

For instance, artists can influence crowd behaviour positively and prevent catastrophic outcomes, such as a crowd crush. They can appeal for calm or can announce any planned evacuation procedures.

In the most recent incident, Swift paused her show to ask crew members to distribute water to fans.

Be safety aware

People who attend mass events also need to be aware of the safety issues related to extreme weather and be prepared.

Public education campaigns can help, as can effectively disseminating safety information to empower attendees to make informed decisions.

For instance, an event organiser can send a text message to all attendees to warn of upcoming weather conditions and a reminder to bring water or wear sunscreen.

We can expect more of these events

The tragic incident at the Swift concert and similar examples are not isolated but indicate a broader trend. With climate change, extreme weather events will pose a more common risk at such mass gatherings.

So we need to recognise and integrate this into how we plan for, and assess the risk associated with, future events. This is vital to ensure these gatherings remain celebratory landmarks rather than avoidable disasters.

"'North America may still be trembling with the aftershocks of two major earthquakes that struck the continent more than a century ago, according to new research.

If the statistical inferences that scientists have made are correct, then that means some tremors of today were set in motion way back in the 1800s, after some of the most powerful quakes in the continent's recorded history.

In fact, the study authors estimate that around 23 percent to 30 percent of the seismic shocks experienced in the New Madrid seismic zone between 1980 and 2016 were aftershocks of four large earthquakes that struck the area in 1811 and 1812, with magnitudes between 7.2 and 8.

What's more, another large quake, with a magnitude of 6.7 to 7.3, which hit Charleston, South Carolina in 1886, could explain up to 72 percent of the seismic shocks experienced in the region since.

The findings hint at the possibility that within geologically stable areas of continents, where there isn't a lot of tectonic activity, some earthquake aftershocks can continue uninterrupted for decades or even centuries, although far more research is needed before that controversial idea can be validated.

""Some scientists suppose that contemporary seismicity in parts of stable North America are aftershocks, and other scientists think it's mostly background seismicity,"" says geoscientist Yuxuan Chen from Wuhan University in China.

Using a different statistical method than previous researchers, Chen, together with geologist Mian Liu from the University of Missouri, analyzed the three biggest earthquake events in North American history.

One occurred in 1663 in Canada's southeastern Quebec. Another struck on the Missouri-Kentucky border starting in 1811. And the last quake hit South Carolina in 1886.

All three of these areas are tucked in the continental interior, away from the borders of tectonic plates, and yet they continue to experience clusters of contemporary tremors.

Modeling the seismic ripples that would have emanated from the three largest historic shocks, Chen and Liu mapped epicenters of around 250 kilometers (155 miles). They then looked at earthquakes that struck near these epicenters in the following decades, including clear shocks above magnitude 2.5.

To figure out how these older and newer quakes were related, the researchers applied the 'nearest-neighbor' method to their data.

Under this statistical method, if earthquakes are too close in space, time, and magnitude to be considered independent background events, then one is assumed to have triggered the other.

Depending on the size and location of the main shock in New Madrid, which is somewhat uncertain, Chen and Liu estimate between 10 and 65 percent of the region's contemporary quakes are likely aftershocks, although the reality is probably towards the lower end of that estimate.

Similar results were found for North Carolina, but in Québec, the authors found predominantly background seismicity.

This indicates that the aftershocks of the Québec earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.5 to 7.5, have disappeared.

""The mixture of long-lived aftershocks and background seismicity may be common in stable continents,"" suggest Chen and Liu.

The two researchers think that the long, post-seismic stress relaxation of stable continents could ""contribute to long aftershock sequences"".

Ultimately, they think the debate over whether North America's contemporary quakes are background noise or aftershocks is oversimplified; the explanations don't have to be mutually exclusive.

""It's kind of a mixture,"" argues Chen.

Susan Hough, a geophysicist with the United States Geological Survey who was not involved in the current study, says that it's possible for apparent aftershocks to deceive.

""In some respects, the earthquakes look like aftershocks if you look at the spatial distribution, but earthquakes could be tightly clustered for a couple of reasons,"" Hough explains.

""One is that they're aftershocks, but also you could have a process of creep going on that's not part of an aftershock process. Exactly what their results mean is still open to question.""

The turbulent debate continues.

"'House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul on Sunday bemoaned the nearly three weeks -- and counting -- that the chamber has gone without a speaker amid conservative infighting over how to fill the key leadership role.

""This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I've seen, because if we don't have a speaker of the House, we can't govern,"" McCaul, a 10-term Republican lawmaker from Texas, told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl.

The crisis in the House is unfolding at a time of growing conflicts abroad -- in Europe, where Ukraine is seeking to repel Russia's invasion, and in the Middle East, where Israel is fighting Hamas in the wake of a terror attack that killed more than 1,400.

""The world's on fire. This is so dangerous what we're doing,"" McCaul said of the paralysis over choosing a speaker.

""We have very important issues right now, war and peace, and we cannot deal with an aid package, or my resolution condemning Hamas and supporting Israel. We can't do that,"" he said.

""Most importantly, it's embarrassing because it empowers and emboldens our adversaries like Chairman Xi [Jinping] who says, you know, democracy doesn't work,"" McCaul said, referring to China's leader.

MORE: US worried about 'attacks on our troops' in Middle East amid Israel-Hamas war: Austin

Kevin McCarthy was ousted as House speaker in early October by a small group of Republicans who were joined by the Democratic minority. Two potential successors to McCarthy were unable to unify Republicans to be elected as his replacement. The conference plans to try again this week.

McCaul said on ""This Week"" that he hadn't chosen whom to back, ""but I want a speaker in the chair so we can move forward.""

He suggested that Democratic votes may be needed to resolve the impasse through some kind of power-sharing arrangement, even if he would prefer otherwise and even if some other Republicans ""see that as very dangerous as well.""

""I'd rather it be the Republicans nominating and voting on the floor for a Republican speaker. But this can't go on forever,"" McCaul said. ""I don't know if we're going to have a speaker next week. I don't know how this plays out.""

On the unfolding Israel-Hamas war, McCaul said he agreed with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also appeared on ""This Week,"" that there was a real danger of a widening conflict in the Middle East.

The U.S. has deployed two carrier strike groups and other military assets to the region in a show of deterrence, Austin said.

McCaul said he applauded those moves ""because Hamas and [the Lebanese militant group] Hezbollah only see one thing, and that's power.""

""If they see weakness, they will fire. And what I worry about Hezbollah, Jon, is that they have 100,000 rockets and precision-guided weapons that can overload the Iron Dome,"" McCaul said, referring to the advanced anti-missile system Israel uses to protect itself.

McCaul added that he is also concerned that Israel's expected ground invasion of Gaza, the neighboring Palestinian territory controlled by Hamas, ""could trigger an escalation by Hezbollah.""

""They're the A-team,"" McCaul said of Hezbollah. ""It's like Hamas is, like, Little League Baseball.""

Karl pressed McCaul -- who has been working on updating the post-9/11 authorization for use of military force to include newer militant groups -- on the prospects of America being more directly involved in the fighting.

""We don't want to see that, and that's why, you know, if we provide deterrence now, we hopefully can avoid war,"" McCaul said.

The chairman said he was broadly supportive of a $105 billion foreign aid proposal that the White House sent Congress last week, which would include about $60 billion for Ukraine, $14 billion for Israel, $7 billion for Indo-Pacific priorities and $14 billion for border management.

""I'm in favor of the concept of linking the biggest threats to the free world. ... We're looking at the numbers. The House, you know, we have the power of the purse, and we appropriate the money,"" McCaul said.

McCaul said he believes it ""would be very dangerous to abandon"" U.S. allies right now, but he acknowledged that there are members of his party who criticize the scope of funding for Ukraine.

""They want accountability. They also want to plan a path to victory and a strategic objective, and I think that's fair,"" McCaul said.

The U.S. and Ukraine both say there are guardrails in place to help ensure the money is well spent; Ukraine has said it wants to expel Russia from all occupied territory.

"'A minor earthquake near Disneyland forced the closure of dozens of rides and left visitors with little to do while employees conducted mandatory safety protocols before reopening the attractions at the Anaheim theme park.

An earthquake in Fullerton on Monday, Dec. 4 centered about 2 miles north of Disneyland forced the temporary closure of at least 35 rides.

“Felt like it was right under our table at Jolly Holiday,” wrote Shanna Fogelman on Instagram. “Shook things up more than you would think.”

The 3.5-magnitude quake at 8:10 p.m. on Monday was centered near Chapman and Raymond Avenues in Fullerton, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. A smaller aftershock struck around 8:30 p.m.

No initial damage was reported at Disneyland or Disney California Adventure.

“Damage is very unlikely but guests will be inconvenienced while rides are inspected,” MiceChat posted to Instagram.

By 9 p.m. Monday night, the vast majority of the attractions in Disneyland and Disney California Adventure were temporarily closed, according to the Disneyland app.

Everything was closed at DCA except for Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind, Mickey’s Philharmagic and holiday versions of Luigi’s Joy to the Whirl and Mater’s Jingle Jamboree. Only Jungle Cruise and the Mad Tea Party were open at Disneyland.

The list of temporarily closed rides at Disneyland included Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones Adventure, Matterhorn Bobsleds, Pirates of the Caribbean, Rise of the Resistance, Space Mountain, the holiday version of It’s a Small World and the new Adventureland Treehouse.

The closed attractions at Disney California Adventure included Radiator Springs Racers, Web Slingers, Toy Story Midway Mania, Soarin’ Around the World and the Incredicoaster.

“All rides are down, all lines are closed and they are telling us after safety protocols are passed they’ll open them back up,” Napa photographer Elise Delamare wrote on Instagram.

Disneyland and DCA employees evacuated some rides as a safety precaution, according to social media posts.

“We were evacuated from Haunted Mansion,” wrote Vivs Candyland on Instagram.

Disneyland’s earthquake protocol calls for rides and attractions to undergo an inspection similar to the daily checks done before park opening. Employees must walk the track, cycle the ride vehicles and inspect the ride systems for potential damage or malfunction.

During those post-quake inspections, employees will empty each ride queue and usually issue readmission passes. Rides could be closed for an hour or more following a minor earthquake. Attractions reopen on a rolling basis as they are cleared for riders.

“When rides reopen, they likely will do so with empty queues and fewer people in the park,” according to Theme Park Insider. “If you can wait out the inspection time after a minor quake, you might find some prime riding time on the other side.”'",climate,earthquake

Forgive the rare Canadian egotism but I'm sure you're thinking ahead of the draw: where is the Canadian national team?! After a seismic rise through 2022 World Cup qualifying that saw Canada top CONCACAF and go to their first World Cup since 1986, it's been tough sledding for Alphonso Davies and co. They have not had a convincing win against a high-end opponent since qualifying. The coach who steered them to the World Cup, John Herdman, migrated to club soccer. They crashed out of both the Nations League and the Gold Cup in unconvincing style and the ugliest blow came last month when they capitulated in the second half against Jamaica in Copa America qualifiers.

A 4-4 aggregate result, with Canada losing on away goals, means Canada didn't automatically qualify for Copa America and will now have to win a one-game playoff against Trinidad and Tobago in March to reach the tournament.

The entire program is going to have their eyes on the draw, but people will be doing so with a lot less confidence than a year or so ago. Canada has looked disjointed in nearly every performance, has struggled in the back and seems to be ignoring the pressing need for squad turnover. It would be a shame for the likes of Davies, Jonathan David, Tajon Buchanan and Stephen Eustaquio to miss out on Copa America as they remain stars in the region. And they desperately need high-level opponents to play against before co-hosting World Cup games in less than three years.'",sports,soccer

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Caleb Porter was hired as coach of the New England Revolution on Tuesday after leading Portland and Columbus to Major League Soccer titles.

Porter replaced Bruce Arena, who quit on Sept. 9, about five weeks after Major League Soccer said he was placed on administrative leave pending a review into allegations he made insensitive and inappropriate remarks. The Revolution scheduled a Jan. 3 news conference to introduce Porter.

The 48-year-old Porter coached Akron from 2006-12, leading the Zips to the 2010 NCAA title. He left to coach the U.S. under-23 team, which failed to qualify for the 2012 Olympics.

He coached the Timbers from 2013-17, beating Columbus 2-1 in the 2015 MLS championship game, then coached the Crew from 2019-22, defeating Seattle 3-0 for the 2020 title. Porter was selected MLS's coach of the year in 2013.

Arena had coached the Revolution since 2019. MLS did not detail its investigation findings except to say in a statement that the probe “confirmed certain of these allegations.” The league said if Arena wants to accept a future position within MLS, he must petition the MLS commissioner.

He was replaced at first by Richie Williams as interim coach and then by Clint Peay.

New England finished fifth among 15 teams in the Eastern Conference with 15 wins, nine losses and 10 ties, then was swept by Philadelphia in a best-of-three playoff.

The Revolution have never won the MLS title, losing the final in 2003, ‘05, ’06, ‘07 and ’14.

"'The Sky are finalizing terms to make Teresa Weatherspoon their new coach, according to her agent, Richard Gray.

Weatherspoon is set to become the Sky’s seventh coach. The former Pelicans assistant has been in talks with the Sky since August but negotiations between both sides picked up in September.

Weatherspoon was hired by the Pelicans in 2019 — the same year she was inducted into the Hall of Fame — as a two-way player-development coach and was promoted to assistant coach in 2020. She parted ways with the team in June.

Last year, she was one of four finalists being considered for the Phoenix Mercury head-coaching job before withdrawing her name from consideration.

A five-time WNBA All-Star and two-time defensive player of the year, Weatherspoon spent seven of her eight playing seasons with the Liberty before joining their coaching staff as their first director of player development in 2015. She coached at Louisiana Tech, her alma mater, from 2008 to 2014, leading the program to back-to-back NCAA Tournament berths in 2010 and 2011.

Weatherspoon will be tasked with leading a roster built around three-time All-Star Kahleah Copper back to a competitive place following a tumultuous season that included former coach/general manager James Wade’s midseason departure and a narrow playoff berth.

The Sky went 18-22 in the regular season and edged out the Sparks for the final playoff spot. They were swept (0-2) by the Aces in the first round of the playoffs, after which the team announced interim coach Emre Vatansever would not return in the role. The Sky went 11-13 with him at the helm.

Copper clarified during exit interviews that the team would be separating the dual role of coach and general manager. According to multiple league sources, the Sky prioritized filling the coach role first and have not begun seriously considering GM candidates.

Sky CEO Adam Fox told the Sun-Times in September that the team was not committed to any timeline to fill the role. WNBA free agency begins in January.

“We’re looking to make the most informed and best decisions possible to make sure we have the right people,’’ Fox said.'",sports,basketball
"'JERUSALEM — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed American support to Israel on Thursday as its military pulverized the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip with airstrikes and prepared for a possible ground invasion. As Palestinians tried to stock up on bread and groceries amid dwindling supplies, Israel said nothing would be allowed into Gaza until around 150 hostages taken captive by Hamas during a weekend attack are freed.

International aid groups warned of worsening humanitarian crisis after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity to the tiny enclave of 2.3 million people and prevented entry of supplies from Egypt. The war has already claimed at least 2,700 lives on both sides.

“Not a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on, and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,” Israeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said on social media.

Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces “are preparing for a ground maneuver” should political leaders order one. A ground offensive in Gaza, where the population is densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.

As Israel pounds Gaza from the air, Hamas militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel.

Palestinians fleeing airstrikes in Gaza could be seen running through the streets, carrying their belongings and looking for a safe place. The number of people who fled their homes soared 30% within 24 hours, reaching 340,000 people by Wednesday night. Most crowded into U.N.-run schools while others are staying with relatives or even strangers who let them in.

Lines formed outside bakeries and grocery stores during the few hours they dared open, as people tried to stock up before shelves emptied. On Wednesday, Gaza’s only power station ran out of fuel and shut down, leaving only lights powered by scattered private generators.

Hospitals, overwhelmed by a constant stream of wounded and running out of supplies, have only a few days worth of fuel before their power cuts off, aid officials say. The cut-off has also caused dire water shortage for over 650,000 people, according to the U.N.

“Without electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues,” warned Fabrizio Carboni, regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross. When power runs out, it puts ""newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can’t be taken,” he said.

With Israel sealing off the territory, the only way in or out is through the crossing with Egypt at Rafah. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said it has not officially closed Rafah but airstrikes have prevented it from operating. Egypt has been trying to convince Israel and the United States to allow the delivery of aid and fuel through Rafah.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to “crush” Hamas after the militants stormed into the country’s south on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people, including killings of children in their homes and young people at a music festival. Netanyahu alleged Hamas atrocities, including beheading soldiers and raping women. His allegations could not be independently confirmed.

Amid grief and demands for vengeance among the Israeli public, the government is under intense pressure to topple Hamas rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza.

Four previous conflicts ended with the group still firmly in control of the territory it has ruled since 2007. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities. A new war Cabinet, which includes a longtime opposition politician, is now directing the fight.

Blinken’s visit underscored American backing for Israel’s retaliation.

“You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourselves, but as long as America exists you will never have to,” Blinken said after meeting with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. “We will always be there by your side.”

Blinken is to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to parts of the occupied West Bank, and Jordan’s King Abdullah II.

Israel captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in a 1967 war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state, but there have been no peace talks in over a decade.

In Gaza, the Israeli military said overnight strikes targeted Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces, including command centers used by the fighters who attacked Israel on Saturday, and the home of a senior Hamas naval operative that it said was used to store unspecified weapons. Other airstrikes killed commanders from two smaller militant groups, according to media linked to those organizations.

“Right now we are focused on taking out their senior leadership,” Hecht, the military spokesman, said of Hamas. “Not only the military leadership, but also the governmental leadership, all the way up to (top Hamas leader Yehia) Sinwar.”

Drone footage filmed by The Associated Press revealed extensive damage at the Shati refugee camp, in the north of Gaza, following overnight airstrikes. Residents picked their way through the rubble as fire and rescue crews looked for survivors.

While Israel has insisted that it is giving notice of its strikes, it is employing a new tactic of leveling whole neighborhoods, rather than just individual buildings.

Hecht said Israel was not “doing carpet bombing, though some people would like to see that.” He said targeting decisions were based on intelligence and civilians were warned.

Even with the warnings, Palestinians say some are unable to escape or have nowhere to go, and that entire families have been crushed under rubble. In the Gaza town of Beit Lahia, Israeli planes dropped leaflets telling people to leave after strikes had heavily blasted the area, residents said.

Jaber Weshah, a 73-year-old rights activist, said there was no warning when a strike leveled a multi-story building neighboring his in the Bureij refugee camp early Wednesday. At least 12 people were killed, including a bookseller, his wife and two toddler daughters and six members of another family, residents said.

“It was an inferno,” Weshah said.

At least 1,000 homes have been leveled and 560 rendered uninhabitable by strikes, according to the U.N.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were killed in the West Bank on Thursday when Israeli settlers sprayed bullets at a funeral for three people killed in a settler rampage the day before. Footage showed Jewish settlers in their cars swerving into the funeral procession and cutting off the road before stopping and opening fire.

The Health Ministry says more than two dozen Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and two in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem since Saturday, most when police fired on stone-throwing protesters.

The death toll in Gaza rose to more than 1,400 killed, the Palestinian health ministry said.

The Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel, a staggering toll unseen since the 1973 war with Egypt and Syria that lasted weeks.

Thousands have been wounded on both sides.

Israel says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead inside Gaza are Hamas members.'",climate,drought

"'As the Director of Food Services at Tampa Bay Downs from 1996-2013, Richard “Dick” Toda tried to make the dining experience as memorable for patrons as the afternoon's racing action.

“We set our standards here as high as possible,” Toda said in a 2012 interview. “When somebody comes up to me and says 'I just had the greatest meal here,' I get a high from that.”

Toda, who also worked as the track's Director of Client Services from 2013-2019 and was on the board of the Tampa Bay Downs Division of the Race Track Chaplaincy of America, died peacefully Thursday at 85.

He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Lucille, and daughters Rene (Raffa) and her husband George; Lisa (Alexander) and her husband Mark; Michelle (Schultz) and her husband Brian; eight grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; and a sister, Patricia (Di Giacobbe) and her husband Fred.

Toda was pre-deceased by two sons, Richard and Michael, and a grandson.

While it's accurate to say food was a lifelong passion for the Warren, Ohio native, Thoroughbred racing and its countless characters, as well as people in general, sparked a joie de vivre Toda shared with everyone he met.

“He was a gracious person who loved life and enjoyed being around all kinds of people,” Lucille said. “We traveled to about 17 European countries, and no one was a stranger to him.”

Toda also loved cooking gourmet meals for Lucille, specializing in Mediterranean dishes from France and Italy.

A graduate of Youngstown State (Ohio) University, Toda – who raced pigeons as a young man with his father, August Toda, Sr., and several uncles – owned five restaurants with Lucille in Tampa, including the downtown Ole Style Deli. Toda struck up a friendship in the early 1980s with Tampa attorney and racetrack owner Stella F. Thayer, who made it a habit to eat at the restaurant.

Thayer gave him a yearly pass to the races, and Toda tried attending every Saturday. He became good friends with Thayer's late husband, Bronson Thayer, as well, and when she decided to upgrade the racetrack's food service, it was a “no-brainer” who to call.

From the beginning, Toda placed an emphasis on quality, originality and friendliness, while seeking input from everyone from the $2 bettor to millionaire owners about what the track could do better.

“Dick came to Tampa Bay Downs to oversee and initiate the operation of food service for the racetrack and brought his expertise and friendly customer service for the benefit of all,” Thayer said. “All involved with Tampa Bay Downs mourn his passing and send condolences to his wife Lucy and his family.”

In his first two years at Tampa Bay Downs, the Skye Terrace kitchen was rebuilt and the Sports Gallery underwent a complete overhaul. His attention to detail helped to attract a diverse customer base, including late New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and prominent Thoroughbred owner Satish Sanan, both of whom sought Toda's company on their frequent visits to the Oldsmar oval.

Toda owned a few horses with Steinbrenner, who called him several times a week, picking his brain about the track's trainers and jockeys as well as seeking his opinions about baseball players.

Mostly, “we would talk about life,” Toda recalled. In 2001, he flew with Steinbrenner on the owner's Learjet to Saratoga to watch his homebred filly Dream Supreme compete in the Grade I Ballerina Handicap.

As a younger man, Toda played a high level of amateur tennis, and his love for the sport continued throughout life. He attended Wimbledon, the French Open at Stade Roland Garros and the U.S. Open. He entertained family and friends on the piano and was a cherished golf partner with a knack for making other players forget how difficult that sport was.

Through the (mostly) ups and downs, Lucille was his guiding light.

“Any time I've thought I can't,” he said in that 2012 interview, “she has been there to reaffirm 'Yes, you can.' She would never allow me not to do my best and has always been my inspiration.”

For many others, memories of Dick Toda will continue to inspire.'",sports,tennis

"'Apr 10, 2019; Houston, TX, USA; MLB Network broadcaster Bob Costas answers questions during an interview prior to the game between the Houston Astros and the New York Yankees at Minute Maid Park. Mandatory Credit: Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports

Former NFL star Tom Brady is expected to transition to the broadcast booth for Fox for the 2024-25 season after a year away from the sport.

Legendary broadcaster Bob Costas detailed in a recent Q&A that he thinks that his advanced football expertise could be better utilized in a different role.

Costas recently spoke with Steve Serby of the New York Post and the two discussed various topics, ranging from personal questions to more professional matters.

Brady’s looming broadcasting career came up and Costas believes Brady would be better as a studio analyst for Fox instead of sitting in the broadcast booth.

“They didn’t ask me and I don’t expect them to,” said Costas. “But if I were running it, I’d use him in the studio rather than on games.”

When asked to expand on this opinion, Costas added that Brady has a “glamor factor” that Fox could better utilize with an on-camera role in the studio.

“The glamor factor, the on-camera factor. And also, it’s less of a strain on him. The level of preparation to work a game and what it takes to get the hang of it, it’s just an easier fit in the studio.”

Costas compared Brady to former New York Yankees star Derek Jeter, who made his debut for Fox back in June and served in a studio role for the network.

“I would say watch Derek Jeter this past postseason. Here’s a guy who was famously circumspect about everything, but was willing in his own way to step out and be more critical than we’ve ever seen him be. Because if you’re not willing to be critical, which is not to be harsh or take potshots, but if you’re not willing to be forthright, then you’re not serving the viewers.”

Costas does raise a good point. Brady would be able to speak his mind more freely as a studio analyst for Fox than he likely would be in the broadcast booth.

The former NFL quarterback has notably been very willing to speak his mind, recently saying that there is “a lot of mediocrity in today’s NFL.”

When you compare Brady to Jeter, there are a ton of obvious similarities. Both are huge names who transcend their sport. And as Costas said, they may both be simply too big to be in the broadcast booth.

Only time will tell whether Fox listens to this advice. But depending on how things play out, a studio role for Brady could be what makes the most sense for both him and Fox.

"'PUTRAJAYA, Nov 11 — The government has allocated RM725.7 million for the implementation of the Flood Mitigation (RTB) project to address the flood problem in the Dengkil area up to Labohan Dagang near here, said the Minister of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change, Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

He said the project, which is a long-term plan under the High Priority Flood Mitigation (TBBT), will be implemented in Sungai Langat Phase 1 and Sungai Langat Phase 2 to address the flood problems affecting about 120,000 residents in the area.

Currently, the implementation of the Sungai Langat Phase 1 RTB Project is in the process of acquiring the site and is expected to be completed in 2027, he said, adding that the Sungai Langat Phase 2 RTB project is expected to start in January 2024 and completed by 2030.

“A short-term measure, maintenance of the drainage system in the area will be carried out more frequently,” he said in a statement today.

The statement was issued in conjunction with his working visit to several flood-affected areas and the Semarang River tidal gate near here today.

Last November 5, several areas were flooded due to continuous heavy rain for an hour including Kampung Sungai Buah, Kampung Jenderam Hilir, Kampung Cemperai, Kampung Seri Tanjung, Taman Delima, Kampung Orang Asli Sungai Melut, FT29/FT32 Intersection and at Jalan Utama Taman Warisan Suria.

The floods affected about 148 houses with a total of 395 residents evacuated to several relief centres. — Bernama

"'JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — The first edition of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States will be staged from June 15 to July 13, 2025, world soccer's governing body said Sunday.

FIFA said the 32-team tournament, which will officially be called Mundial de Clubes, would be “harmoniously aligned with the International Match Calendar” to ensure there would be enough of a gap between the final and the start of domestic leagues.

“Clubs play a fundamental role in world football, and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 will be a major milestone in providing clubs from all confederations with a fitting stage on which to shine at the highest level of the game,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. “This will be an open competition based on sporting merit that will play a key role as part of our efforts to make football truly global.”

The last edition of the Club World Cup in its current guise is currently being held in Saudi Arabia, where Champions League winner Manchester City is aiming to win the trophy for the first time.

An annual tournament called the Coupe Intercontinentale de la FIFA will be played from 2024 between the Champions League winner and the winner of a play off between champions from the other soccer confederations.

"'A 4.1-magnitude earthquake was reported in Isleton, California on Wednesday (October 18), according to the United States Geological Survey.

"'MOUNTAIN REST — A little over one week into burning, the Mill Mountain fire in Oconee County has claimed nearly 700 acres and reached some of its containment lines.

Less than a quarter-inch of rain fell over the weekend, slowing the fire but not bringing it to a halt. On Nov. 10, it had burned 675 acres, and the weather was enough help to slow its growth. As of Nov. 13, the fire was still 675 acres and 50 percent contained.

The fire management team is hopeful the blaze will reach its break lines soon, bringing it to 100 percent containment by the end of the week, U.S. Forest Service Spokesman Jeff Davids said.

""As fuels dry out from recent precipitation, there may be an increase in smoke production over the next couple of days,"" Davids said.

The current response includes four fire engines, two bulldozers and two helicopters. A fire break line, which includes the Chattooga River, has been created around the fire. Fighting the fire directly isn't an option in the hilly terrain, Oconee County Emergency Services Director Scott Krein said.

The closure of Burrells Ford campground and the section of the Foothills Trail from Burrells Ford to Big Bend remain in place.

Fires and fireworks are currently banned in the Andrew Pickens Ranger District of the Sumter National Forest. The Mill Mountain fire was detected on Nov. 4 and had burned around 50 acres when the U.S. Forest Service sent its crews on Nov. 5.

"'New York Liberty's Breanna Stewart (30) shoots over Las Vegas Aces' Kelsey Plum during the second half in Game 3 of a WNBA basketball final playoff series, Sunday, Oct. 15, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)

NEW YORK (AP) — Breanna Stewart and the New York Liberty fell just short of winning the franchise's first WNBA championship, losing to the Las Vegas Aces in the Finals.

It was the first time that Stewart experienced losing in a championship round since her freshman year of college. The league's MVP won the two Finals series she played with Seattle and won four NCAA championships at UConn. Her lone loss in a title game came in the Big East Tournament her freshman season.

“Making sure that I don’t feel that again, I think that’s really my mindset and mentality going forward,” Stewart said Friday.

New York hopes to bring back most of the same team next season. Stewart could be an unrestricted free agent but Liberty general manager Jonathan Kolb said that he would give her the franchise tag so that she can't sign a contract directly with another team.

“It’s my first time being cored. Not surprising,” Stewart said. “I’m excited for what we’re doing here in New York and with the Liberty. … I’m looking forward to it for many years to come.""

Stewart is focused on trying to bring the city a championship.

“This isn’t the goal that we had at the start of the season. We didn’t want to just get to the Finals. We weren’t content with being one game away from winning the whole thing,"" she said. ""But we wanted to win, and really just building off of that and not forgetting what it feels like to be here.”

While Stewart definitely isn't going anywhere in the near future, the Liberty will need to figure out a way to re-sign free agent Jonquel Jones, who flourished in the playoffs. She averaged 17.0 points, 11.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in the postseason.

Jones, who came to New York in a trade in the offseason, is also an unrestricted free agent.

“She’s a player that we definitely want to retain, and we’ll continue those talks into the offseason,” Kolb said.

Jones enjoyed her first season in New York and said she's ""definitely trending towards coming back here.”

The Liberty already have Betnijah Laney, Courtney Vandersloot and Sabrina Ionescu signed for next season. Ionescu revealed on Friday that she was dealing with a hip injury in the WNBA Finals that she sustained against Connecticut in the previous round.

Ionescu refused to use the ailment “as an excuse” but said she was not 100% in the Finals. She averaged just 9.7 points and shot 31.5% from the field in the four games.

“I had to get an injection before (Game 1) just to be able to play those first two Vegas games,” she said. “So obviously, not ideal. It’s just kind of what happens. There’s no excuse obviously but, I mean, I wasn’t really able to walk, so timing wasn’t great.”

"'AEW Rampage Results 10/20 - Mistico Vs. Rocky Romero, #1 Contenders Triple Threat Match

Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s results for ""AEW Rampage"" on October 20, 2023, coming to you from the Fort Bend Epicenter in Rosenberg, Texas!

Two reigning CMLL champions will be going head-to-head tonight, as World Historic Welterweight Champion Rocky Romero takes on World Historic Middleweight Champion Mistico in a Two Out Of Three Falls Match for Mexico's Pound-for-Pound Crown. While the two are quite familiar with one another in the squared circle, this will be their first time meeting in an AEW ring with Mistico making his debut for the company.

Ruby Soho hasn't competed in a match since coming up short to Hikaru Shida in a Number One Contenders match for the AEW Women's World Championship on the September 29 episode of ""Rampage"". Tonight, she will be making her return to the ring as she goes one-on-one with Skye Blue. Blue has been showcasing a darker side to her personality since having black mist sprayed on her face by Julia Hart.

Speaking of Number One Contenders matches, Orange Cassidy's next challenger for the AEW International Championship will be determined as Dark Order's John Silver, Brother Zay, and Kip Sabian collide in a Triple Threat match. Cassidy began his second reign as titleholder after defeating Rey Fenix on the October 10 episode of ""AEW Dynamite"".

Additionally, Claudio Castagnoli and Wheeler Yuta of Blackpool Combat Club are set for a match as they look to pick up another win. The pair are currently on a two match winning streak, having previously defeated Gates of Agony, and Levi Shapiro and Wise Guy Ruiz.

"'The journey for the U.S. men’s national team in next year’s Copa America will begin with a match against Bolivia on June 23 in Arlington, Texas.

Teams in this year’s tournament, which will take place in the U.S., learned their group opponents on Thursday in the final draw, which was held in Miami.

The 16-team tournament will be played in 14 U.S. cities.

The Americans, the top seed in Group C, will also face Panama (June 27 in Atlanta) and conclude group play against Uruguay on July 1 at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.

Uruguay is considered the stiffest challenge in the group.

“We always knew it was possible,” USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter told the Fox Sports broadcast about drawing Uruguay in the group. “They’re the hardest team in pool 2. For me, it’s an opportunity and a good challenge for our group. We have to do a good job of setting up the first two games.

“In a way, we’re controlling our own destiny by playing them (Uruguay) last. The first two will be difficult games.”

The U.S. played Uruguay to a scoreless draw in an exhibition ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

The Americans should be favored to win their first two games, facing the lowest-ranked team in South America (Bolivia, No. 85 in the latest FIFA Rankings) and Panama, a familiar team from the CONCACAF region.

“I think Panama is the most improved side in CONCACAF,” Berhalter said. “They beat us in Gold Cup, so it will be a challenge. For us, this is like a mini-World Cup.”

Panama beat the U.S. in penalty kicks in last summer’s Gold Cup semifinals.

“If there’s not pressure, you don’t get diamonds,” Berhalter said.

The top two teams in each group move on to the quarterfinals. If the U.S. advances, it will meet Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Costa Rica or Honduras. By winning its group, the U.S. might avoid a quarterfinal against the Brazilians.

“You know what’s lurking around the corner in Group D, most likely, so you want to try to finish first,” Berhalter said. “Brazil is one of the favorites to win the tournament, so it’s going to be a real challenge in that next round, so you’d like to play them in the semifinals.”

The tournament will be the USMNT’s first big assignment since Berhalter was rehired and serves as one of the crucial tests that the program will have before the 2026 World Cup. With that tournament being played in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, those three nations will not have to go through the qualifying process.

Defending Copa America and World Cup champion Argentina (Group A) is the top seed in Group A and will face Peru, Chile and the winner of the Canada-Trinidad and Tobago playoff.

Argentina will open the tournament on June 20 against either Canada or Trinidad and Tobago at Mercedes-Benz Arena in Atlanta.

Mexico is the top team in Group B. El Tri will face Ecuador, Venezuela and Jamaica. The game against Venezuela (June 26) will be played at SoFi Stadium. Mexico was the top seed in Group B after winning the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

The final group is led by Brazil, which will be joined by Colombia, Paraguay and the winner of the Costa Rica-Honduras playoff. Brazil’s match against the playoff winner will be played on June 24 at SoFi Stadium.

The Copa America, the oldest continental competition in the world, is usually a tournament comprised solely of South American countries. Ecuador was in line to host the Copa América as part of the rotation by South American soccer’s governing body but declined. The event was moved to the U.S. and expanded to include six countries from North and Central America and the Caribbean.

The last time the tournament was played in the U.S. was in 2016, when the Americans defeated Ecuador in a quarterfinal, 2-1, then were eliminated with a 4-0 loss to Argentina. The U.S. also had a fourth-place finish in 1995.

Mexico’s best finish in the tournament was second place in 1993. In 2016, El Tri advanced to the quarterfinals.

Argentina and Uruguay have both won the tournament 15 times and Brazil is next with nine titles. No team from outside of CONMEBOL has ever won the tournament.

Led by captain Lionel Messi, Argentina won the 2021 Copa América in Brazil, 1-0, for its first continental title since 1993, then last year captured its third World Cup and first since 1986.

Matches for this tournament also will be played at Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Kansas City, Kansas; and Orlando, Florida.

The semifinals will be in New Jersey on July 9 and North Carolina the following day. The quarterfinals are in Houston on July 4, Arlington the next day and Glendale, Arizona and Las Vegas on July 6.

"'The House Republican campaign arm announced Tuesday that it broke its fundraising record for an off-year November.

“With partners like this and an incredible political environment, extreme House Democrats should dread yet another cycle in the minority,” he added.

"'(CNN) — Manchester United announced Sunday that British petrochemical billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe purchased a 25% stake in the famed English Premier League soccer club.

The sale was confirmed by Manchester United and Ratcliffe-controlled INEOS, a London-based multinational conglomerate.

INEOS said in a statement that Ratcliffe will acquire 25% of the club’s Class B shares and up to 25% of its publicly available Class A shares “and provide an additional $300 million intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford,” the club’s historic stadium. The Glazer family, which owns the majority of the club, and Class A shareholders will receive the same price of $33.00 per share, the club said. On Friday, shares of Manchester United (MANU) closed at $19.81.

In May, Forbes valued Manchester United at $6 billion, just behind Real Madrid as the world’s most valuable soccer club. Shares of Manchester United had been down nearly 13% in 2023.

The deal still requires approval from the English Premier League.

“We are delighted to have agreed (to) this deal with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS,” said Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer, Manchester United’s executive co-chairmen and directors, in a statement. “As part of the strategic review we announced in November 2022, we committed to look at a variety of alternatives to help enhance Manchester United, with a focus on delivering success for our men’s, women’s and Academy teams.”

That statement added that “the joint ambition is to create a world-class football operation building on the Club’s many existing strengths, including the successful off-pitch performance that it continues to enjoy.”

The sale comes after over a year of rumors that the Florida-based Glazer family, which has owned the club since 2005 and also owns the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was interested in accepting offers. There have been multiple rounds of bids, which had included Qatari investor Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, who withdrew his bid in October, according to multiple reports.

Manchester United has struggled in recent years under the Glazer family’s ownership. The club, which have had four full-time managers since long-time boss Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013, have not won a UEFA Champions League title since 2008, and have not captured a Premier League title since 2013.

Manchester United are currently eighth in the Premier League table.

Ratcliffe, 71, was born in Failsworth, Lancashire, which is part of Greater Manchester. He has described himself as “a local boy and a lifelong supporter” of Manchester United. Ratcliffe, one of Britain’s richest men with a net worth of $19.1 billion, according to Bloomberg’s billionaire index, previously launched a failed bid for London club Chelsea, which fetched $5.3 billion in May 2022.

Ratcliffe also owns soccer clubs OGC Nice in France and FC Lausanne-Sport in Switzerland.

When a new wildfire starts in the forest, wildland fire dispatchers are the people in charge of getting resources where they need to go. Their early decisions can help to keep a small fire from getting huge. But a 2022 survey of wildland fire dispatchers in Oregon and Washington by the U.S. Forest Service found that “dispatch is experiencing problems that compromise their own health and safety” as well as “the health and safety of other firefighters,” according to a new article in High Country News. Kylie Mohr, a correspondent for High Country News who wrote that story, joins us to talk about it.

Note: The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer.

Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB. I’m Dave Miller. When a wildfire starts, wildland fire dispatchers are the people in charge of getting resources where they need to go. Their decisions can help to keep a small fire from getting out of control. But a recent survey by the forest service found that wildfire dispatchers in Oregon and Washington are dealing with issues that are a threat to their own health and safety as well as the health and safety of other firefighters. Kylie Mohr wrote about this for High Country News and she joins us now to talk about it. Welcome to the show.

Kylie Mohr: Thanks so much for having me.

Miller: Can you give us a sense for what the job actually entails, what wildland fire dispatchers do?

Mohr: Absolutely. So like you said, dispatchers are often some of the first people who are in charge of calling in resources when a fire is reported. So when a new fire needs air tankers or helicopters dropping retardant or water, dispatchers are the ones coordinating what’s flying where, so the aircraft don’t collide. If firefighters get hurt during a fire, dispatchers are the ones who are sending medical help to oftentimes really remote areas. And then once the fire is underway, dispatchers relay information to and from the fire line like wind, humidity, temperature forecasts. So they do a lot, but they’re a really crucial link kind of in the communication and operations chain.

Miller: How much of the decision making falls on their shoulders? I mean, is it up to them to decide whether or not to put out a specific fire, or is that a higher up manager?

Mohr: That’s not really the dispatcher’s decision. Decisions about how or if to fight a fire are made by other people on the ground or people higher up the leadership chain of command. But then those people are the ones calling the dispatchers with what they want and what they need and the dispatchers are then in charge of figuring out how to execute those requests and get resources, people, where they need to be as quickly as possible.

Miller: Can you give us a sense for what dispatchers might be exposed to, what they might hear, the conversations they might have over the course of a shift?

Mohr: Dispatchers are in a really high contact position because they’re communicating with people, sometimes on multiple fires at once. So kind of on the severe end of things, they might overhear chatter or be involved in operations that include finding injured or killed civilians in the middle of a fire. They might be involved when a firefighter is critically injured by a snag, or some other accident on the fire line. The fire community is really pretty tight knit and small, and so sometimes they might overhear conversations about something bad happening to someone that they know. Worst case scenario, one of the dispatchers I spoke with for the story actually ended up overhearing two different firefighter fatalities playing out during her shift. So there can definitely be some pretty traumatizing things that dispatchers are exposed to.

Miller: Why did the U.S. Forest Service conduct a survey of dispatchers in Oregon and Washington last fall?

Mohr: A risk manager for the region, his name is Matt Holmstrom, and he’s a Forest Service employee who led this whole effort. And he told me it’s been a really long time since dispatchers have been kind of examined or checked in on, in this far reaching way, and that it was really overdue. He also told me that the agency really needs to understand its problems in order to find solutions. So that was his approach to the survey.

Miller: What were you able to learn about the scope of the survey?

Mohr: So it included detailed interviews with about 104 of the 189 dispatchers that work in the 14 largest dispatch centers in Region 6, which is agency lingo for Oregon and Washington. And dispatching, like firefighting, tends to be pretty interagency in nature, because fires cross jurisdictions quickly. So oftentimes there’s Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, State Agency, etcetera dispatchers, all working in the same center. So the survey also included people employed by those other entities, not just Forest Service.

Miller: You filed a FOIA request, a Freedom of Information Act request, to get access to a presentation of the survey results as well as transcripts from some of those interviews with over 100 dispatchers. But that request was denied. What did you hear?

Mohr: Well, the Forest Service said releasing those materials would compromise its decision making ability and prematurely announce proposed policies. We appealed that denial and we’re still waiting to see if that gains any traction. They did release some emails as part of the FOIA that were mostly just about the planning process, but the communication did have some kind of illustrative gems in it, including leadership acknowledging that, quote, “Our margins for error are so slim now due to vacancies and increases in workload.”

Miller: What else were you able to learn about the results of the survey?

Mohr: Absolutely. So, I was lucky enough to have some Powerpoint presentation slides of the survey leaked to me and that really helped kind of flesh out the story. That’s how I knew that recruitment, retention and vacancies were identified as major issues, among a bunch of other things that I think we’re going to talk about in this interview. The survey also identified, the interviews identified some kind of unnerving anecdotes. For example, one dispatcher had to have emergency medical surgery because they were so short staffed the person couldn’t take bathroom breaks, but they had known gallbladder issues. And another, an entire dispatch center was on the verge of quitting during fire season last year and even though that didn’t end up happening, there was a lot of turnover and now the center is really short staffed with almost no backup in key positions. So yeah, the slides were very helpful in flushing it all out.

Miller: As I mentioned in my intro, the survey found that dispatchers were experiencing problems. It compromised their own health and safety as well as the health and safety of firefighters on the line. Let’s take these one by one, starting with that second one. How might problems that a dispatcher is experiencing affect the health and safety of firefighters?

Mohr: So the survey identified that problem without giving super specific examples. But the thought is that if dispatch centers aren’t fully staffed or if the dispatchers are exhausted or dealing with mental stress and trauma that there’s more room for mistakes, basically. So maybe resources don’t get called in fast enough. So firefighters end up in harm’s way, in the path of a fire, or maybe communications break down. So firefighters don’t know about something that they should, that would benefit their safety, that kind of thing.

Miller: I mean, I guess it’s analogous to say air traffic controllers, if the people in the towers are super stressed out, if it’s understaffed, if they can’t do their jobs well enough, there could be disasters, as we’ve been talking about, hearing about recently in other places. So, what about the health and safety of dispatchers themselves? What have you heard?

Mohr: Yeah. So some additional research on dispatchers nationwide, I think really helps us answer this question. Some researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technologies Ozark Research Station, which is such a mouthful, they did a survey of over 500 dispatchers nationwide and it found that 10% were considered at high risk for suicide compared to 0.3% of the general population. So that’s a really striking and sad comparison. And the survey work that they did also found that dispatchers have really high rates of signs of depression and signs of PTSD compared to the general population. So, I think it’s safe to say that they’re experiencing some really challenging mental health issues.

Miller: Are they getting support for the work-based mental health challenges that they’re experiencing?

Mohr: That really varies, but overall my reporting found that dispatchers are often forgotten when it comes to mental health support. The dispatcher I mentioned earlier who overheard multiple fatalities said she felt overlooked and wasn’t offered the kind of trauma-informed resources that are out there. And in some instances, this can lead to dispatchers trying to numb their pain with alcohol and drugs, which is a really slippery slope that both of these surveys identified. The Forest Service survey team said that what’s really needed is the creation of stress first aid materials that are specifically tailored for dispatchers. And also that the Forest Service really needs to follow its existing stress management protocol. So the protocols might exist, but if they’re not being offered to dispatchers, then they’re not doing their job.

Miller: What did you hear about workloads and work life balance? You mentioned earlier that the agency did mention recruitment and retention and vacancies as issues. So clearly, they’re aware of what not having enough people doing these jobs means. But for the people who are there, how many hours do they have to work?

Mohr: It’s really tough. Over half of survey respondents said that they had little to no work/life balance. Many of them feel forced to take on overtime work. They can’t get time off, they don’t receive adequate breaks, shifts can be up to 16 hours long or more during fire season. One dispatcher even told me that his personal record is over 24 hours. So that’s a full day and night of working in this high stress position. And that creates a really vicious cycle where the more experienced dispatchers are heavily relied upon, they’re overworked, then they quit and then the people who are left have even more on their plate.

So it just kind of keeps cycling through and that lack of work/life balance can be really harmful. The dispatcher’s ability to show up for their friends, their relationships, their families, to be present in their life outside of work and fulfill other commitments or obligations that they might have.

Miller: How does pay factor into this?

Mohr: Pay is definitely an issue. Dispatchers say that better pay would really help recruit and retain more people which theoretically should kind of help everything we’ve been talking about. An average Forest Service dispatcher’s base pay is roughly $15 to $20 an hour, and as we know, that’s barely a livable wage in Oregon and elsewhere in the West. Pay for firefighters in general is sort of up in the air right now, with these temporary pay raises that some dispatchers also received from the Infrastructure Bill, they’re set to run out. And there’s work going on in Congress right now to try to figure out a long term solution for that. But there’s also uncertainty around the future of what dispatcher retirement benefits will look like in the long term. And all of that really adds up to a pretty unstable financial picture for dispatchers and another reason that they say they might not stick around.

Miller: You noted that the reason the agency - the U.S. Forest Service - gave you for not releasing the details of the survey is that it could get in the way of the policy changes that they could institute as a result of this survey. Do you have any sense for how they might change their policies as a result of what they’ve learned?

Mohr: I wish I had a better answer to that question. Systemic changes at the federal level, as a result of this survey, are pretty murky right now. When I asked specifically the question that you just asked me, what policies or changes might come about as a result of the survey, a Forest Service spokesperson was fairly cagey and kind of told me just to stay tuned. There are some small changes underway, that includes things like more training for leadership and dispatch centers on how to handle stressful situations and some sharing of resources between centers to help bring short term people up to speed quicker. But none of that is really the systemic, broad policy change that the survey really seems to point towards needing.

Miller: Kylie, thanks very much.

Mohr: Thank you.

“You want to play at a high level. But then family is a lot. My son is 16 and then two girls. So, [I’m] looking forward to seeing them grow up in those important years.”

"'When your head coach calls you a “repeat offender,” you know your days with that team might be numbered.

So it was somewhat startling when Tennessee Titans coach Mike Vrabel said, in January, that linebacker David Long Jr. (and then-Titans teammate Kristian Fulton) were “repeat offenders” with soft tissue injuries that kept them from playing multiple games last season.

Two months later, Long signed with the Dolphins, beginning a relationship that has been mutually beneficial.

Long -- signed as a replacement for Elandon Roberts — has distinguished himself as one of the run-stuffing anchors of the league’s sixth-rated defense, on a team with Super Bowl aspirations.

He leads the Dolphins (and ranks 47th in the league) with 78 tackles, a pace that would surpass his career high of 86.

Pro Football Focus rates Long the league’s best linebacker against the run this season.

In light of Vrabel’s comments, is there any extra motivation going against the Titans on Monday at Hard Rock Stadium (8:15 p.m., ESPN, CW-39)?

“Yeah, a little bit, a little bit,” Long said Thursday. “But he knows the type of player I am. He knows what he’s going to get and I plan to deliver that.”

At the time of Vrabel’s comments, Long said it was “unfortunate [those remarks] created a narrative about how” he takes care of his body and that it would only add to the chip on his shoulder this season.

After missing a combined 12 games the past two years, Long hasn’t missed a game this season.

He said coming to Miami (on a two-year, $12 million deal) has been a good marriage because “the type of players we have, especially on the D-line, we have a lot of aggressive players. I just fit right in. We have a lot of playmakers. Not too many robots on this team. I’m excited to be a part of it.”

What impresses his teammates is the ferocity to Long’s game.

“In 2 yards he can bring all his power into you,” linebacker Jerome Baker said before his knee injury on Sunday. “If you see him in a hole, and a lot of people don’t see it, but you can hear it, you can feel it. It can be a quick hole open and a back is about to hit it. He’s not just stuffing [you], he’s ‘Boom!’ He’s an explosive guy.”

Long’s instinct is “he wants to get in on every tackle,” Baker said. “And he just plays hard, bro. Plays how a linebacker should play. It’s definitely fun playing next to him.”

Teammates on the other side of the ball notice, too. Hard contact with Long is best avoided.

“He’s very intense on the field,” offensive tackle Austin Jackson said. “Chasing him, he’s fast too. I’m like 6-5 and he’s probably like 6-0, 5-10. If I’m not bracing myself to make contact with him with my knees bent, that’s tough for me. He executes on those type of things all the time. Every time I’ve talked to him in the locker room, he’s always got a smile on his face. Cool dude, but on the field he’s a monster.”

Long said he developed that physical tackling mentality in fifth grade, after his mother moved him from one little league team to another in Dayton, Ohio, so that he could play with his cousin.

The upshot was that he ended up having to grow up quickly playing tight end and linebacker against bigger players, in a little league that permitted tackling.

“My momma took me to a different football team, the Dayton Flames, and we were national champions,” Long said. “They put me against the biggest dude. For me, it was you are either going to put up or shut up.”

He said his coach “put me up against the biggest guys and develop that mental state where [a bigger player] might hit you and you might go down, but it’s about how you adapt and react to circumstances. We played against older kids. It was the environment where it made me grow sooner. You know the kids that go to the back of line? We were the ones in the front.”

Years later, the seeds sown in little league in Dayton are felt by teammates and opponents.

“He’s one of those dudes that will hit anything and get up screaming,” Dolphins linebacker Bradley Chubb said. “He has that contagious energy that you need as a defense. It’s been helping us out a lot.”

PFF has a metric called run stop that uses a complicated formula to determine a negative play for an offense, based on down and distance and yardage gained. In the run game, Long has 22 such stops in 194 snaps where the opponent runs the ball. Nobody with fewer than 200 of those snaps has more run stops except, coincidentally, Pittsburgh’s Roberts.

“Throughout training camp, if I saw No. 51 and it was an inside zone and I had to go block that dude, I wasn’t exactly too fired up about it,” fullback Alec Ingold said.

When Long sees his former team Monday, “of course there will a little more fire on me. [But] to say I’m going to try to bring anything extra, it would be like I wasn’t giving it the week before. I attack every week the same.”'",sports,baseball

An empty lot where a house once stood in Houston. The former residents moved because of flood damage. A new study suggests that people are moving away from the most flood-prone neighborhoods in cities that are otherwise growing in population. Claire Harbage / NPR

Hundreds of thousands of neighborhoods in the United States are seeing population decline as a result of flooding, new research suggests. Those neighborhoods are often located in areas that are growing in population overall, including parts of Florida, Texas and the region around Washington, D.C.

The results underscore how flood risk – which is growing due to climate change – is already affecting where Americans live.

""People are being more selective about where they live,"" says Jeremy Porter, one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the First Street Foundation, a research and advocacy organization that publishes analyses about climate hazards including flooding. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

Americans are flocking to some of the most flood-prone parts of the country, including coastal areas, and low-lying cities in Florida, Texas and coastal Virginia. At the same time, heavy rain and sea level rise from climate change means floods are getting larger and more frequent.

As a result, the cost of flood damage in the U.S. has skyrocketed in recent years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, home insurance companies and climate and housing experts all warn that huge financial losses from flood damage are not sustainable for families or the economy.

At the same time, people buying homes are increasingly aware, and wary, of flood risk. More and more states are requiring that homebuyers receive information about whether a house has flooded before, and whether it is likely to flood in the future. Some real estate listing sites include information about flood risk. And people are less likely to search for flood-prone properties when they are given information as part of the listing about whether a home flooded in the past or is likely to flood in the future, according to a study by the real estate website Redfin.

But if people are trying to avoid moving to flood zones, why are so many people ending up in the most flood-prone parts of the country? The authors of the new study offer some new insight.

They looked at the number of people living in each of the more than 11 million census blocks in the contiguous U.S., and analyzed how that number changed in places with high exposure to floods versus lower exposure to floods. They found that about 7% of census blocks – which are roughly the size of a city block – are experiencing population decline due to flood exposure.

They estimate that those neighborhoods saw a net loss of about 9 million residents between 2000 and 2020. And they found that many of those neighborhoods are located in places that are growing overall, such as South Florida and Southeast Texas.

The results suggest that the influx of new residents into flood-prone cities such as Miami and San Antonio may obscure the millions of people who are moving more locally to get away from the lowest-lying neighborhoods in those cities.

Moves to the Sun Belt ""are a macro migration trend,"" explains Porter. ""But they're dwarfed by the amount of people that move within their same city. Keep the same job, keep the same friends, stay close to family.""

Previous research has found that most people stay local when they move to a new home, including in situations where a flood disaster forced them to relocate. That means decisions about where to live and how to stay out of harm's way often come down to block-by-block or even house-by-house comparisons.

And, while flood risk appears to play a role in where people choose to live, social factors including race and class are also hugely important, says Kevin Loughran, a sociologist at Temple University who studies relocation from flood zones.

""Flood risk, or environmental risk in general, is not the only criteria they're using to make these decisions,"" says Loughran.

The new study offers a new level of national insight into how flood risk might be affecting local trends in population, he says. But the details are still fuzzy, and further research is underway by social scientists and others to study exactly how people who live in areas threatened by climate hazards decide whether, and where, to move.

“We actually ended up with the eighth-driest dry season in the last 30 years,” Kodama said. “All four counties had at least D2 conditions, severe drought, at the end of the dry season,” Kodama said. “In some places, especially in Maui County and on the Big Island, we had some places in extreme drought, D3.”

The D3 sections on the Big Island are primarily in and around Upolu Point and Ka Lae, also known as South Point, the northernmost and southernmost points on the island.

“The consensus of the climate models is forecasting large-scale, drier-than-average conditions throughout the entire wet season,” Kodama said. “This is a little bit different from what you would normally expect from an El Nino. Normally, with a strong El Nino, drought takes hold in mid-December at some point, then extends into February and March. But this time around, we’re actually in it. We’ve already started it.”

May to November is tropical cyclone season in Hawaii, although El Nino — a climate condition marked by higher-than-normal water temperatures in the equatorial Pacific — might render that season almost as meaningless as the wet season is forecast to be.

“One of the hallmarks of El Nino for the Hawaiian Islands is that we do have the potential for the extension of the hurricane season. Hurricane Iwa was during an El Nino year. That was in late November (1982). Supertyphoon Paka affected Guam, but it generated in the Central Pacific. It was a December (1997) system. And back in the 2015 season, the record-breaking season, we actually had a December system, and we even had one in January. We could see an extension of the hurricane season, so in this type of climate pattern, we encourage folks not to let their guard down.”

And while the drought already is occurring, according to Kodama, “Conditions are just expected to get worse.”

“The sectors that are sensitive to short-term rainfall deficits, they’re going to have the most severe drought impacts,” he said. “We’re talking about nonirrigated crops. Anybody who’s on water catchment may already be seeing impacts. Normally, the wet season is when you see some rainfall relief. The vegetation starts to restore. That’s not expected to happen right now. So, we’re looking for the potential for a lot of out-of-season brush fires.

“Especially by the end of February, we’re looking at statewide, widespread moderate drought conditions, D1 category. And embedded in that, we’re going to see many areas with D2 to D4 conditions, which is severe drought to exceptional drought in various areas of the state. What we’re looking at is the potential for having more than 40% of the state to be in at least D2 conditions. Right now, about 16% of the state is D2 or D3.

“This drought, we’re looking at extending well into next year and even into the next dry season.”

"'Industry groups urged Congress to once again avoid a spending bill deadlock ahead of an upcoming vote on the issue, citing concerns about flood risks and operational impairments.

(Update: The House passed a stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown the evening of Nov.14. A new deadline for government funding of military construction, veterans' affairs, transportation, housing and the Energy Department was set for Jan.19, 2024 by newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. The Senate subsequently approved the measure.)

Eleven organizations, including the Community Home Lenders of America and the Mortgage Bankers Association, warned that 20,000 areas across the country could be jeopardized by a lack of flood coverage. The National Association of Realtors estimated that the absence of federal insurance for the risk, as part of a budget impasse, could disrupt 1,300 property sales.

""Averting a shutdown will prevent these disruptions to the real estate, home building, and mortgage lending sectors, which make up over 20% of the U.S. economy,"" said the coalition, which included the Housing Policy Council, Leading Builders of America, Manufactured Housing Institute, National Apartment Association, National Association of Home Builders, National Housing Conference, National Multifamily Housing Council and U.S. Mortgage Insurers.

If federal flood insurance became unavailable due to a shutdown, some coverage could be obtained in the growing private market , but more than two-thirds of those needing it could have trouble with access.

Even without a government shutdown — which could also interrupt housing programs and underwriting verifications, and raise rates — new studies suggest the flood risk, in line with associated coverage , is growing increasingly expensive.

The expected annual damage that flood risk poses to federally backed mortgages, based on experience dating back to 2020, is $9.4 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office study released Monday.

By 2050, the estimated EAD in 2020 dollars could be anywhere from $10.2 billion to $16.1 billion, based on the range of lower-than-anticipated and upper-end projections for disaster risk.

While the National Flood Insurance Program addresses some of that risk, 40 to 50% of it lies outside areas on federal maps that designate it for coverage, the CBO found. Those maps can be inaccurate reflections of risk due to departures from historical experience and update lags.

Flood risk is a concern to all types and sizes of mortgage businesses to some degree, with property damage from it hurting the value of servicers' collateral and loan performance. Access to coverage is a potential impediment to new originations.

With nonbanks and chartered mortgage subsidiaries of depositories still generating losses , according to the latest quarterly data released from the MBA, neither side of the business can afford any setbacks. Rates have remained elevated, meaning most of their profits have come from servicing.

A whipsaw change in rates as would be likely in a government shutdown is unlikely to benefit either servicing or origination as volatile swings can lead to costly operational and valuation adjustments.

Rate-indicative bond yields were lower at deadline Tuesday due to a lower-than-anticipated inflation reading but if there's a government shutdown on Friday, when stopgap funding is set to run out, they'll likely soar.

A shutdown ""could push rates higher, because the greater the risk, the greater the rate,"" Melissa Cohn, regional vice president, William Raveis Mortgage, said in an email comment Tuesday morning.'",climate,flood

"'A magnitude 4.2 earthquake shook part of Northern California between the state capital and the San Francisco Bay region on Wednesday, setting off automated quake alerts.

The 9:29 a.m. quake was centered in the agricultural Isleton area about 32 miles (52 kilometers) southwest of Sacramento, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The area is largely occupied by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.

Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services spokesperson Kim Nava said there were no immediate reports of harm from the quake. In particular, Nava said there were no reports of damage to the area’s extensive levees that protect farmland.

"'WILLIAMS — It was just before 8 a.m. on a clear fall day when trucks carrying fire crews barreled down dirt roads into Kaibab National Forest.

Shortly after, the crews began to set over 2,300 acres of the ponderosa pine ecosystem ablaze.

The Kendrick Prescribed Fire Project was one of the first of many prescribed burns this fall and winter throughout Arizona with the goal of protecting forest lands and surrounding communities from the threat of potentially catastrophic wildfires.

The prescribed burns in Kaibab National Forest are part of the U.S. Forest Service’s 10-year wildfire crisis strategy, which aims to combat wildfires in high-risk forest landscapes.

The strategy began in January 2022 as a response to the growing threat of wildfires in the West over the past 20 years due to climate change, accumulating fuels and development. It emphasizes the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems, which rely on regular fire exposure to stay healthy.

In other words, the Forest Service aims to fight fire with fire.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, the Forest Service will receive $5 billion over 10 years, including $1.8 billion that will be used to increase forest treatments in 11 new landscapes across Western states. Those treatments include prescribed burns.

Preventing catastrophic wildfires

Prescribed burns are a wildfire prevention method that involves burning an area of land in a controlled manner in order to minimize the risk of future catastrophic wildfires.

“The objective of many of these prescribed fires is to reduce forest fuels in the area,” said Zach Boness, burn boss for the prescribed burns in Kaibab National Forest. “We live in a fire-dependent ecosystem in northern Arizona, and so fire is part of how these trees remain healthy, how the forest remains healthy.”

“Forest fuels” refer to anything in the forest that can burn, including dead plants, dead trees, built-up leaves and pine needles. If these materials aren’t burned away in a controlled manner, they can build up and become fuel for dangerous wildfires, causing them to spread quickly and burn longer, making it difficult for fire crews to contain a wildfire once it starts.

In areas like the Kaibab forest, wildfires are often started by lightning strikes. When there is a lot of fuel on the forest floor, the fires can spread quickly.

Areas that have been pre-burned, though, don’t burn as intensely and often won’t burn at all since the forest fuels have already been burned off, according to Bob Blasi, a Kaibab National Forest fire information officer.

“A raging fire headed straight towards a pre-treated area will usually just go and drop,” Blasi said. “Wildfires can stop dead in their tracks, literally, when they hit a pre-treated piece of ground like this.”

According to Blasi, once a piece of land has burned, it likely won’t burn again for another 10 to 15 years.

“We do have empirical evidence that speaks to the effectiveness of these prescribed fires and other fuels treatments in slowing down and allowing us to be more successful when fire suppression is required,” Boness said.

Environmental benefits

The ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona rely on regular fire exposure to encourage biodiversity.

“When you don’t have fires frequently, then the forests get very dense,” said Andrea Thode, a professor of fire ecology and fire science in the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. “The trees are very close together, they don’t grow in diameter and they don’t get a lot bigger.”

When there is an excess amount of trees, the amount of forest fuels on the ground increases, making it difficult for native plant species to flourish. Additionally, when the canopy of trees is thicker, less sunlight can reach the ground to encourage photosynthesis.

Where plants struggle to grow, wildlife struggles to live. Species such as elk rely on the forbs, grasses and shrubs that grow in the ponderosa pine forests, but when forests are dense, they aren’t able to access their food supply.

Prescribed burns help manage forest density and burn off the build-up of fuels on the ground, allowing for more plants to grow. Additionally, when a prescribed fire burns through an area and blackens the trunks of trees, it leaves behind ash rich in minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen, Thode said. These minerals then soak into the soil on the ground and boost the plant growth.

Prescribed burns help ensure that these minerals can soak into the ground.

“At certain temperatures, nitrogen will volatilize, so it goes from that solid state to a gaseous state and is lost to the system,” Thode said, “but with low-severity fires, it’s released and so you do get an ash that has a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus in it.”

Thode said that even species that tend to prefer living in denser forest ecosystems benefit from prescribed burns. Mexican spotted owls, a threatened species that resides in northern Arizona forests, roost in dense groups of trees, but they require more open areas when hunting for food.

“Removing the more continuous fuels, making (forests) more heterogeneous landscapes, changes the way that fire can move through that landscape to protect those areas, even if they do need to be more dense where the owls are nesting,” Thode said.

Prescribed burns do produce smoke, which releases carbon into the atmosphere, but according to Thode, it’s much less intense and harmful than the smoke from a catastrophic wildfire.

“It’s not really if it’s going to burn,” Thode said. “It’s when it’s going to burn and how it’s going to burn.”

The process of prescribed burns

These burns are planned months ahead of time. Early aspects of planning include organizing crews, planning burn locations, developing prescriptions, organizing permits and informing the public.

“There’s more to it than just a bunch of cavemen dragging drip torches around,” Blasi said. “It’s a very detailed organization, and it requires a lot of experience level from the top all the way to the bottom.”

Specialists also develop a burn plan, or “prescription.” This prescription takes into account weather, environmental risks and location to determine the best conditions for a burn.

Then, crews head to the location to begin preparing. They prepare bulldozer lines, which are clear areas that act as barriers for a particular burn, and they clear out some of the harder-to-remove excess fuels with saws so that the burns are easier to control.

While plans are determined ahead of time, they are often subject to change due to the unpredictability of factors like weather and humidity.

“We’re prepping right up until the day of, making sure we have the resources that are needed and getting folks in place for all that,” Boness said.

On the day of, crews begin by gathering at a morning briefing led by burn bosses. Boness was the burn boss in charge of the prescribed burns in the Kaibab National Forest, aided by burn boss trainee Ryan Allen.

“We’re ultimately the ones in charge of the operations out here on our prescribed fire,” Boness said. “We coordinate with both our firing group and our holding group as well as coordinating between the agency administrator and our other overhead personnel to make sure we’re answering questions and that all the permits are in place, that all of our bases are covered so that we’re following our policy.”

At the briefing on Oct. 5, Boness and Allen went over the plans for the day’s burn to make sure everyone from each crew was on the same page and knew where they were assigned.

After the briefing comes the test fire, where the burn bosses observe a small, controlled fire to ensure that the forest conditions will allow for it to burn the way they want it to.

“If that’s successful for us, if we see that we’re meeting our conditions, meeting our prescribed fire window, then we’ll continue with our general ignitions,” Boness said.

Following a successful test fire, the fire crews get to work. Ground crews first “blackline” the area set to burn, using drip torches to ignite thin lines of fire on the outer edges to act as a barrier preventing fires from spreading outside the prescribed area.

Then, a helicopter equipped with a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) drops small fireballs, no larger than a ping-pong ball, inside the perimeter to burn the area quickly and efficiently while putting fewer workers at risk.

As the PSD operator for the prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, Christian Cortes was in charge of releasing four to five fireballs per acre. Inside the PSD machine, the balls are injected with ethylene glycol, which causes them to ignite once they hit the ground.

“It’s like an art; there’s a certain way to do it to avoid balls from flying all over the place or losing control of anything,” Cortes said.

Throughout the prescribed burn process, safety is a priority, Blasi said. As firing crews lay down blacklines and the helicopter drops fireballs, holding crews drive trucks around the edges of burn areas to make sure that fire isn’t jumping from already burned “black” areas into unburned “green” areas. If they see a spot where the fire has jumped across the line, they put it out. Fires are continuously monitored as they burn through the night.

Additionally, each burn is assigned an air resource adviser and meteorologist. The adviser from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality monitors the smoke to determine health risks while the meteorologist helps ensure that the burns are safe to complete under current weather conditions.

Sometimes, areas are completely blocked off during prescribed burns for the safety of the public. The prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, though, were deemed safe enough to allow people to drive next to where the fires were burning.

“We use it mostly for an opportunity to educate people,” Blasi said. “We want them to come up close to see it, we want them to understand why it’s important.”

Lindsay Nava, a recent graduate from NAU, said that the Forest Service’s work with prescribed burns is part of what inspired her to get involved in fire control. She has worked as a crewmember on various prescribed burn projects for the past year.'",climate,heatwave

A new study warned that artificial intelligence technology could cause a significant surge in electricity consumption.

The paper, published in the journal Joule, details the potential future energy output of AI systems, noting that generative AI technology relies on powerful servers and that increased use could drive a spike in demand for energy.

The authors point to tech giant Google in one such example, noting that AI only accounted for 10%-15% of the company's total electricity consumption in 2021.

But as AI technology continues to expand, Google's energy consumption could start to be on the scale of a small country.

VETERANS PLAGUED BY ERRORS IN HEALTH BENEFIT SYSTEM DUE TO COMPUTER MISHAP

""The worst-case scenario suggests Google’s AI alone could consume as much electricity as a country such as Ireland (29.3 TWh per year), which is a significant increase compared to its historical AI-related energy consumption,"" the authors wrote.

They cautioned that such an example ""assumes full-scale AI adoption utilizing current hardware and software, which is unlikely to happen rapidly.""

Christopher Alexander, the chief analytics officer of Pioneer Development Group, told Fox News Digital the demands will be similar to the birth of Bitcoin mining, arguing developers will have to get creative with the way they use resources.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

""AI is very similar to Bitcoin mining. In both cases, processing power is used at very high intensity to solve problems. You cannot lessen the energy consumption , but you can mitigate it,"" Alexander said. ""For example, alternative energy, like natural gas from oil drilling that is burned off rather than used is a major untapped energy source along with biogas from landfills.""

Alexander likened the solution to when ""kerosene was developed from waste,"" arguing that this is another opportunity to develop cheap energy from flare gas and landfills that powers the future and makes the most of resources that would otherwise become pollutants.""

Phil Siegel, the founder of the Center for Advanced Preparedness and Threat Response Simulation (CAPTRS), told Fox News Digital that similar concerns are a feature of any growing technology , though he argued that improvements will likely come to help make energy consumption more efficient.

""Multiplayer gaming, social media and cryptocurrency have all gone through these phases. Early on, the technologies tend to be inefficient as the chips and algorithms are not optimized,"" Siegel said.

""People extrapolate these inefficiencies to a larger scale. The bad news is that energy usage does increase somewhat. The good news is that as the new uses scale, the chips get better, the algorithms improve, the technology gets more creative, and it eventually lowers the amount of energy usage far below panic levels.""

While the paper acknowledges some of the scenarios are extreme and unlikely cases, it argues that it is important to temper ""overly optimistic and overly pessimistic expectations"" for the future, noting that ""it is probably too optimistic to expect that improvements in hardware and software efficiencies will fully offset any long-term changes in AI-related electricity consumption.""

""These advancements can trigger a rebound effect whereby increasing efficiency leads to increased demand for AI, escalating rather than reducing total resource use,"" the paper's conclusion states.

""The AI enthusiasm of 2022 and 2023 could be part of such a rebound effect, and this enthusiasm has put the AI server supply chain on track to deliver a more significant contribution to worldwide data center electricity consumption in the coming years.""'",climate,forest fire

BARCELONA, Spain — Tighter water restrictions for drought-stricken northeast Spain went into effect Wednesday, when authorities in Catalonia said that Barcelona might need to have fresh water shipped in by boat in the coming months.

Catalonia is suffering its worst drought on record with reservoirs that provide water for about 6 million people, including Spain’s second-biggest city Barcelona, filled to just 18% of their capacity. By comparison, Spain’s reservoirs as a whole are at 43% of their capacity.

Spanish authorities and experts point to the impact of climate change in the increasingly hot and dry weather behind the extended drought in Catalonia.

Barcelona has already been relying on Europe’s largest desalination plant for drinking water, and a sewage treatment and purification plant to make up for the drop in water from wells and rivers.

Catalonia officially entered the “pre-emergency” phase for drought, which lowers the daily use per person from 230 to 210 liters (60 to 55 gallons) of water per day. That includes personal use as well as what town halls use per inhabitant for services. Catalonia’s water agency says that the average person in Catalonia consumes on average 116 liters (30 gallons) per day for domestic use.

Municipal governments are now prohibited from using drinking water for street cleaning or to water lawns. Water limits for use in industry and agriculture have been increased.

If water reserves fall below 16% capacity, then Catalonia would enter into a full-blown drought “emergency” whereby water would be limited to 200 liters (52 gallons) per person, and then potentially dropped down to 160 liters (42 gallons) per person, and all irrigation in agriculture would require previous approval.

Authorities have warned that the drought “emergency” could just be weeks away, unless it rains — a lot.

If not, then Barcelona could need tankers to bring in drinking water. In 2008, that extremely expensive measure was used to keep the city supplied during a drought.

“Unfortunately, we have to be prepared for every scenario, and we are close to needing boats to bring in water if the situation that we have seen over the past months continues,” Catalonia regional president Pere Aragonès said during a trip to South Korea on Wednesday.

Aragonès said that his administration was working with Spain’s ministry for the ecological transition to prepare for the eventuality of the water tankers. He added that his administration would prefer to bring in water for southern Catalonia where the Ebro River meets the Mediterranean Sea.

"'The Detroit Tigers signed veteran starter Kenta Maeda this week, but they’re not done yet.

“We’re going to keep looking to add pitching,” said Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris. You’ll never hear me say that we have enough pitching. I don’t even believe it’s possible to have enough pitching. We’re going to see what’s available and if we can find more ways to make our staff deeper and better overall.”

There’s good news for the Tigers if they plan to do any holiday shopping: The shelves are still stocked.

In fact, while the crop of free-agent position players might be the weakest in recent memory, the strength of this year’s class neatly aligns with the Tigers’ wish list: Mid-tier starting pitcher.

We found 11 pitchers remaining on the market who are in a similar price range to Maeda, who signed for two years and $24 million.

Could the Tigers make a splash and go after recently posted Japanese pitchers Yoshinobu Yamamoto or Shota Imanaga? Of course.

But it’s far more likely that someone on the list below ends up in Detroit next year.

Here are the possibilities in no particular order. Contract estimates are courtesy of Fangraphs’ crowdsourced predictions; MLB Trade Rumors’ annual projections; Jim Bowden’s predictions for The Athletic; and future value estimates of Baseball Trade Values.

1. Seth Lugo

Age: 34

The right-hander just wrapped up his first full season as a starter 2017, posting a 3.57 ERA in a career-high 146 1/3 innings with the San Diego Padres. He’ll be looking to cash in with the first multiyear contract of his career.

Contract estimates:

2 years, $26 million (Fangraphs)

3 years, $42 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $20 million (The Athletic)

2 years, $28.4 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Lugo signed with the Kansas City Royals for a deal worth a reported $45 million over three years.

2. Mike Clevinger

Age: 33 in December

Once a mainstay in the Cleveland rotation, Clevinger spent last year with the White Sox, posting a 3.77 ERA in 131 1/3 innings. His strikeout numbers are well down for his heyday, but he has good command and is seen as a safe mid-rotation option. On a one-year deal, he’d be a bargain. But the second year -- which most expect him to get -- could be a tougher call.

Estimates:

2 years, $24 million (Fangraphs)

2 years, $26 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $25 million (Baseball Trade Values)

3. Jack Flaherty

Age: 28

After battling injuries for parts of three seasons, this was supposed to be a showcase year for Flaherty before hitting free agency. He did end up throwing 144 innings between the Cardinals and Orioles, and his 4.36 FIP was far better than his 4.99 ERA. The projections for Flaherty are all over the place. He could get two or even three years because of his age. But might he prefer a one-year deal to position himself for another run at free agency next winter?

Estimates:

2 years, $20 million (Fangraphs)

3 years, $40 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

1 year, $10 million (The Athletic)

2 years, $26.8 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Flaherty signed with the Tigers for one year and $14 million.

4. Michael Lorenzen

Age: 32 in January

Hey, we know this guy! Lorenzen was the Tigers’ All-Star representative in 2023 and then was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies at the deadline. He threw a no-hitter for his new team and then struggled the rest of the way. Did he pitch well enough overall to score a two-year deal? Most projections say yes.

Estimates:

2 years, $20 million (Fangraphs)

2 years, $22 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $22.6 million (Baseball Trade Values)

5. Nick Martinez

Age: 33

After a detour to Japan, Martinez came back to the States in 2022 and has spent the last two years as a hybrid starter/reliever, logging 100 innings in each of the last two seasons for the Padres. That sort of versatility could be appealing to the Tigers.

Estimates:

2 years, $18 million (Fangraphs)

2 years, $25 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $18.6 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Martinez has signed a two-year deal worth a reported $26 million with the Cincinnati Reds.

6. Sean Manaea

Age: 32 in February

The former A’s ace has posted a 4.73 ERA over the last two seasons (4.26 FIP) and he worked some out of the pen for the Giants in 2023. After a disastrous start to the season, he had a 3.44 with 97 strikeouts in 91 innings after May 17.

Estimates:

2 years, $24 million (Fangraphs)

2 years, $22 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $32.2 million (Baseball Trade Values)

7. James Paxton

Age: 35

Age and health would be the only concerns with signing this veteran lefty. When healthy, he’s about as consistent as they come.

Estimates:

1 year, $8 million (Fangraphs)

1 year, $8 million (The Athletic)

1 year, $11.7 million (Baseball Trade Values)

8. Hyun Jin Ryu

Age: 37 in March

Ryu hasn’t pitched a full season since 2021 due to Tommy John surgery, so teams will look closely at how he pitched down the stretch. If he’s healthy, the Korean lefty would make a lot of sense on a one-year deal.

Estimates:

1 year, $10 million (Fangraphs)

1 year, $8 million (The Athletic)

1 year, $11 million (Baseball Trade Values)

Cleveland Guardians starting pitcher Lucas Giolito throws during the first inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)AP

9. Lucas Giolito

Age: 30 in July

Giolito endured a strange summer, being traded from the White Sox to the Angels and then to the Guardians. He didn’t pitch well for the latter two teams. How much that will affect his free agency remains to be seen. He was one of the league’s best from 2019-2021, but he won’t be paid like it. That could lead him to seek an opt-out after Year 1 to try to cash in if he has a bounce-back year.

Estimates:

2 years, $30 million (Fangraphs)

2 years, $44 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

2 years, $24 million (The Athletic)

2 years, $40.2 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Giolito signed a two-year deal with the Boston Red Sox worth a reported $38.5 million in guaranteed money.

10. Frankie Montas

Age: 31 in March

Montas was a stud with the Athletics but has given the Yankees virtually nothing due to injuries. He’s a prime bounce-back candidate.

Estimates:

1 year, $8 million (Fangraphs)

1 year, $15 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

1 year, $16.4 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Montas signed a one-year, $16 million deal with the Cincinnati Reds.

11. Luis Severino

Age: 30 in February

Once upon a time, he was an elite pitcher, but injury setbacks and serious struggles in 2023 make it unlikely he’ll get more than one year.

Estimates:

1 year, $10 million (Fangraphs)

1 year, $14 million (MLB Trade Rumors)

1 year, $12.6 million (Baseball Trade Values)

UPDATE: Severino has reportedly agreed to a one-year, $13 million contract with the New York Mets.'",sports,baseball
"'PARIS (AP) — Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep is no longer working with coach Patrick Mouratoglou’s academy while she awaits a ruling on her appeal of a four-year doping suspension and figures her tennis career will be over if the Court of Arbitration for Sport rules against her.

“Four years is going to be a lot for my age,” Halep, a 32-year-old from Romania who has been No. 1 in the WTA rankings, said in an interview with euronews posted online Friday.

“It’s catastrophic if it’s going to be four years,” she said. “And I don’t know how I will handle it. Probably it’s going to be (the) end of (my) career, yes.”

A three-day hearing with the Court of Arbitration for Sport is scheduled for Feb. 7-9 in her appeal against the International Tennis Integrity Agency, which ruled that Halep “committed intentional anti-doping rule violations.”

Halep tested positive for the drug Roxadustat at the 2022 U.S. Open and also was cited for irregularities in her biological passport. Roxadustat stimulates the body to produce more of the natural hormone erythropoietin, or EPO, which has long been a doping product favored by cyclists and distance runners.

Halep said in Friday’s interview that she hasn’t spoken to Mouratoglou since “a few months ago.”

In a video Mouratoglou posted on Instagram in November, he took blame for providing a tainted substance to Halep.

“We brought her collagen from a company. This collagen happened to be contaminated,” Mouratoglou said. “There was no way to know it. But I feel responsible for what happened because it’s my team — so me, basically — who brought her this collagen.”

Halep won the French Open in 2018 by beating Sloane Stephens in the final, and Wimbledon in 2019 by defeating Serena Williams in the title match.

She spoke with euronews in Paris and said she hopes she wins her appeal and will be eligible to compete in next year’s Summer Olympics in that city.

“I know I didn’t do anything wrong and I know I’m clean,” Halep said.

"'Actor Ralph Bellamy’s film, stage, radio and TV career spanned 65 years — from screwball comedies like 1940’s “His Girl Friday” to “Trading Places” in 1983 and “Pretty Woman” in 1990 before he passed at age 87 in 1991.

Now, a Midtown Manhattan apartment once owned by Bellamy, a founder of the Screen Actors Guild, has hit the market for $875,000 — down from $1.25 million last year.

The home is at the landmarked Osborne, across from Carnegie Hall. Maintenance charges are $3,666 a month. The second-floor, two-bedroom, one-bath co-op was later owned by Virginia Dortch Dorazio, ex-wife of Italian artist Piero Dorazio, who bought the apartment in the 1980s.

The residence opens to stairs that descend to a foyer, which leads to a large living room. Design details include 12-foot-high beamed ceilings, original herringbone wood floors, a decorative stone fireplace and a large bay window.

French doors open to a Juliet balcony overlooking 57th Street. A hall leads to a main bedroom with a custom closet built to house Bellamy’s suits, and an ensuite bath. A small kitchen can be expanded and reconfigured.

"'Residents of Beirut see parallels with Israel’s tactics 42 years ago and today’s campaign on the Palestinian enclave.

West Beirut, Lebanon – As poets and writers flit in and out of Sleiman Bakhti’s bookshop and publishing house in Beirut’s Hamra neighbourhood, he greets each one as an old friend, often handing them the latest book release.

He has been a “Hamrawi” for decades – living through Hamra’s peaks and troughs, including the dark days of the civil war, which, despite their harshness, brought people together.

“There was resilience and solidarity and hope for freedom against the enemy that wanted to destroy Beirut,” Bakhti, now in his 60s, tells Al Jazeera in his shop.

That atmosphere of “light and hope”, Bakhti says, stands in stark contrast to the ongoing slaughter in Gaza today, where each day new horrors are relayed to the world by the few remaining journalists on the ground.

Hamra’s heyday

Long seen as a Middle East cultural and intellectual hub, Hamra had everything from movie theatres to publishers, to cafes full of political dissidents or exiles from around the region in the years leading up to the Lebanese Civil War.

Among the exiles were many Palestinians, including Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and famous Palestinian writer and revolutionary Ghassan Kanafani. They had come to Lebanon along with the rest of the Palestinian political leadership after being expelled from Jordan after its 1970 civil war.

After the 1967 war in which Israel occupied more of Palestine, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were violently displaced from their homes in a second wave of expulsions after the Nakba of 1948.

Many ended up in neighbouring countries, including Jordan, from where resistance fighters launched attacks on Israel, drawing retaliations that eventually led to Jordan expelling them.

Arafat and the Palestinian Armed Struggle Command had by then already signed the Cairo Accord with Lebanon, essentially approving the presence of Palestinian fighters and granting Palestinian control over Lebanon’s 16 Palestinian refugee camps.

Israel used the presence of Palestinian resistance as justification for invading southern Lebanon and besieging West Beirut in 1982.

The siege and aggression by Israel and their domestic allies the Lebanese Forces live on for West Beirutis who find it hard to forget what then-US President Ronald Reagan reportedly called a “holocaust” in a phone call with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.

Parallels

Many West Beirutis see parallels between the violence of 42 years ago and what is widely acknowledged as an ongoing genocide in Gaza.

“The only difference now is how many people are dying,” Ziad Kaj, a novelist and former member of the city’s Civil Defense Unit, said.

More than 21,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, about half of them children. In the siege of West Beirut, some 5,500 people in Beirut and surrounding suburbs are estimated to have died, with staff at one hospital saying up to 80 percent of casualties were civilians.

“I’m not surprised [by the Israeli tactics],” Kaj said.

In 1982, the Israelis and the Lebanese Forces set up checkpoints around West Beirut and cut off electricity. Communication with the outside was rare as phone lines were down.

Israeli officials called on civilians to leave West Beirut and charged Arafat and the PLO with “hiding behind a civilian screen”.

Medical supplies, food and other necessities were severely restricted and scarce, despite occasional attempts to smuggle essentials in.

“West Beirut was surrounded,” Kaj said. “There was no bread, water, or gas, and near-daily bombardment came from land, air and sea.”

“In the morning we would look for bread and often we wouldn’t find it,” Abou Tareq, a resident of Hamra in his 70s, told Al Jazeera. “Vegetables and meat weren’t available at all.”

History is being repeated today in Gaza, where Israeli officials frequently accuse Hamas of using “human shields” and 40 percent of the population is at risk of famine.

In Beirut, the water shortage meant residents had to resort to sweet carbonated drinks or unclean well water that caused stomach ailments. In Gaza too, people have been forced to drink non-potable salt water.

And much like in Gaza, there were so many casualties in Beirut that doctors did not always have time to administer anaesthesia.

Typhoid and cholera spread like wildfire among Beirut’s children after the lack of garbage collection led to an increase in rat bites. Stress was pervasive, with accounts saying the bombing caused “extreme psychosomatic effects”.

People in Gaza have seen an increase in meningitis, chickenpox, jaundice and upper respiratory tract infections as their healthcare system has collapsed.

Shouting at a Beirut sky

“Sometimes the bombing went on for 24 hours straight,” Bakhti said of 1982.

The famous Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish lived in the Dabbouch building back then, Bakhti told Al Jazeera, pointing down the street.

“One day, he came out onto his balcony and started shouting at the Israeli warplanes.”

US academic Cheryl A Rubenberg described, in Palestine Studies, bombing that started at 4:30am and carried on into the evening. After a week of this, she wrote in 1982, she was suffering “anorexia, nausea, diarrhoea, insomnia, the inability to read or write a coherent paragraph, persistent uterine bleeding and a constant feeling of nervousness and tension”.

Israel’s bombing in Gaza has been non-stop for nearly three months, with only a week-long humanitarian pause in late November.

Many residents of West Beirut fled the city to houses in the mountains or East Beirut, though some stayed behind to work or to try to keep squatters away from their property.

Bakhti stayed in West Beirut to keep an eye on his relatives’ homes. “I had many keys and I would go check on their houses,” he said.

“I went to check on my parents’ house and there was white phosphorous residue on the walls.”

Beirut’s hospitals struggled to deal with burn victims after Israel used phosphorus on West Beirut, where 500,000 people lived, including many who were internally displaced from south Lebanon.

International human rights organisations have documented Israel’s unlawful use of US-supplied white phosphorus in Gaza and south Lebanon since October 7.

“We lived the [1982] siege but this [Gaza] is genocide,” Bakhti said.

“This is worse than death.”'",climate,drought
"'TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - While recent snow seems to have had a positive effect, most of Kansas continues to be impacted by less severe drought conditions.

As of Thursday, Dec. 28, the U.S. Drought Monitor shows that most of the state remains either moderately, abnormally or severely dry. Very few parts of Kansas show no drought intensity.

As for Shawnee Co., about 10% of the county has no drought intensity while nearly 27% is abnormally dry. Meanwhile, 57% of the county remains moderately dry while nearly 6% is in severe drought. The Drought Severity Code Index for the county was recorded at 158.

Compared to the previous week, the recent snow seems to have had a small impact on Shawnee Co. as the DSCI dropped from 243 to 158. Compared to the same time in 2023, the DSCI has dropped from 176 to 158.

Statewide, about 34% of Kansas is in a moderate drought while 26% remains abnormally dry. About 20% of Kansans are not in a current drought while nearly 17% are in a severe drought. Lastly, nearly 3% of the Sunflower State is in an extreme drought.

The DSCI for Kansas was recorded at 156 compared to a whopping 348 one year prior. Currently, there are nearly 921,000 Kansans in drought areas.

Historically, water officials said those in moderate droughts have seen increased fire danger, low pond levels and poor habitats in migratory flyways. Wheat grasses can also be drought-stressed and increase the demand for hay for livestock.

Impacts of severe drought include blue-green algae as ponds and streams dry up. Burn bans could be implemented as fireworks sales are banned and more grass fires occur. Wheat, corn, soybean and hay yields could also be low as the crops are severely damaged.

Meanwhile, extreme drought could mean high amounts of cattle are sold off as emergency grazing is opened while corn and wheat crops fail as pasture conditions are poor. Emergency water supplies are also needed while river levels are low and municipal water restrictions are implemented. Major infestations of locusts could also occur as quail and pheasant populations decline and trees are stressed.

Lastly, exceptional drought, which none of the state is currently seeing, could bring about fish kills as all aquatic species and food chains are affected. All crops could also be severely impacted and unharvestable as the ground cracks. Irrigation could be turned off as rivers dry up and wildfires and large dust storms impact residents. The economy could also be negatively impacted.

The Supreme Court seemed unconvinced Wednesday that denying trademark protection for T-shirts with the phrase “Trump too small” violates the First Amendment.

The justices peppered the lawyer defending t-shirt maker Steve Elster with skeptical questions during oral arguments in Vidal v. Elster, gravitating toward the government’s argument that trademark protections do not restrict speech, but rather are a government benefit conferring a commercial advantage. The phrase, which the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) denied Elster protection for under a trademark law restricting the registration of names, is a reference to Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s crude joke about Trump’s “small hands” during a 2016 presidential debate.

TRENDING: Time to take the gloves off in 2024

“You know what they say about guys with small hands,” Rubio told the crowd at the time. Elster’s registration request stated that he wanted to express “that some features of President Trump and his policies are diminutive,” according to court documents.

Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested that history, alone, undermines the foundation of First Amendment arguments raised by Jonathan Taylor, the attorney defending Elster, pointing to a long record of other content-based restrictions like geography.

“At the end of the day, it’s pretty hard to argue that a tradition that’s been around a long, long time, since the founding, common law type stuff, is inconsistent with the First Amendment,” Gorsuch said.

Kagan pushed Taylor to name a single Supreme Court case where a viewpoint-neutral restriction on the provision of a government benefit was deemed a First Amendment violation.

“You can’t find is a case that supports your proposition,” she said.

Section 2(c) of the Lanham Act prevents the registration of trademarks that include “a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual” without the person’s written consent. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found in February 2022 that the USPTO’s decision to deny the trademark based on the act “unconstitutionally restricts free speech in violation of the First Amendment” by limiting criticism of public figures, a decision the Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court.

Justice Clarence Thomas raised a point brought up by Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, who argued on behalf of the government, that Elster remained free to sell T-shirts and other products containing the phrase, even without a trademark.

“What speech, precisely, is being burdened?” he asked Taylor.

Of the nine justices, Justice Samuel Alito seemed most sympathetic with the First Amendment claims, spelling out exactly where he stands: he won’t side with the government on the theory that the restriction is a condition attached to a government benefit.

“I mean, you don’t need my vote to win your case,” he told Stewart. “I’m trying to see if you have any argument … maybe you’ve just decided, well, Alito is a lost cause here.”

In his final appeal to the justices, Stewart posed another hypothetical — a New York car dealer who tries to register the trademark “the Derek Jeter of car dealers” and says he performs “with the same excellence and professionalism that New Yorkers have come to associate” with Miami Marlins CEO Derek Jeter.

“He could worry, if this person can call himself the Derek Jeter of car dealers, next there will be the ‘Derek Jeter’ of orthodontists’ and the ‘Derek Jeter of barbers,” Stewart said. “And the value of his name will be reduced, will be diluted.”

"'Jessica Pegula, of the United States, returns a shot to Coco Gauff of the United States, during a women’s singles semifinal match at the WTA Finals tennis championships, in Cancun , Mexico, Saturday, Nov. 4, 2023. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano)

CANCUN, Mexico (AP) — Jessica Pegula outplayed U.S. Open winner Coco Gauff and beat her 6-2, 6-1 at the WTA Finals on Saturday in a matchup between American doubles partners on a rainy and windy evening to reach the title match at the season-ending championship for the first time.

Their semifinal was tied at 2-all when the fifth-seeded Pegula — a 29-year-old born in New York and now based in Florida who is a decade older than Gauff — reeled off six games in a row to claim the opening set and lead 2-0 in the second.

This was the first time two U.S. women played each other in the final four at this event since 2002, when Serena Williams defeated Jennifer Capriati. When Saturday’s semifinal ended after an hour, Pegula and the third-seeded Gauff met at the net for a hug.

“Coco is still the present and the future of U.S. tennis. I’m happy that I’m also at the top of the game and one of the leaders for all the Americans,” Pegula said. “So that’s always really nice. And that’s kind of just where I see myself.”

They were scheduled to play a doubles match together later Saturday, but that was wiped out by rain — and the second singles semifinal, between No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and No. 2 Iga Swiatek, was suspended for the night. They were in just the fourth game when a storm arrived.

Action was halted with Swiatek leading 2-1 and Sabalenka serving at 30-all. Both wrapped themselves in white towels to brace against the chill. Organizers waited for nearly two hours before calling off all competition for the day.

Swiatek and Sabalenka were scheduled to resume their match Sunday; the singles final, originally slated for Sunday, was pushed back to Monday.

Sabalenka won the Australian Open in January and was the runner-up to Gauff at the U.S. Open in September. Swiatek won the French Open in June for her fourth major championship.

“They’ve won Grand Slam titles and big events before, so I’m assuming I’ll probably be the underdog again,” Pegula said, “even though I’m playing some really great tennis.”

Pegula has won all eight singles sets she’s played this week at the tournament for the top eight players in women’s tennis. She is the first player since Williams in 2012 to get to the final without dropping a set.

Gauff vs. Pegula started about an hour late because of showers — bad weather has been a theme throughout the WTA Finals — and then was delayed by two rain interruptions in the second set of just under 15 minutes each. Shifting breezes affected the way balls traveled.

“She was playing well with the wind and I wasn’t. So, yeah, that’s pretty much it,” Gauff said, mentioning that they didn’t have the chance for a full warmup before getting on court to play. “At the end of the day, she was the more experienced player when it came to these circumstances. So I’m not going to blame the weather or anything. We were in the same boat.”

It’s true: None of that seemed to slow Pegula, who is bidding for the most prestigious title of her career.

“To get through here in such a tough field is going to give me a lot of confidence going into next year,” said Pegula, who is on a nine-match winning streak, including a run to the Korean Open trophy last month. “I thought I’ve been able to handle all the opponents that I faced really well, even in the conditions and stuff like that.”

"'Plans for a European Super League bringing together elite football clubs such as Real Madrid and FC Barcelona won a surprise boost at the European Union’s top court after judges ruled the sport’s main governing bodies violated antitrust law by thwarting the project.

UEFA and FIFA are “abusing a dominant position” by applying arbitrary rules on approval, control and sanctions, the E.U.’s Court of Justice said in a binding ruling on Thursday.

The proposed league, which initially involved six leading teams from England, three from Italy and three from Spain, crumbled in 2021, just days after its creation, following a public uproar, as well as threats from World Cup organizer FIFA and European counterpart UEFA that any player or club taking part would be expelled from their competitions. The collapse was inevitable after all the English clubs involved pulled out of the project, followed by Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan.

A22 Sports Management, the company behind the rebel league, sued UEFA and FIFA in Spain, claiming their threats were an “insurmountable barrier” to the new tournament and broke antitrust law. The dispute ended up in the bloc’s top court with judges asked to weigh in with answers to questions on the scope of E.U. law in a key test of the governing bodies’ future powers.

“We have won the right to compete. The UEFA monopoly is over,” said A22 chief executive officer Bernd Reichart in a statement after the ruling. “Clubs are now free from the threat of sanctions and free to determine their own futures.”

FC Barcelona said the judgment “paves the way for a new elite level football competition in Europe by opposing the monopoly over the football world” and said it “wishes to initiate new discussions as to the path that European competitions should take in the future.”

Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez said the ruling heralded a “new era” where clubs can act “without threats, without acting against anything or anyone” with the aim of “innovating and modernizing soccer to continue to feed the passion of the fans.”

But while attacking the behavior of the football federations and their abuse of power, the E.U. court said it still wasn’t a given that the Super League must necessarily be approved.

“The court, having been asked generally about the FIFA and UEFA rules, does not rule on that specific project in its judgment,” it said in its statement. “Given their arbitrary nature, their rules on approval, control and sanctions must be held to be unjustified restrictions on the freedom to provide services,” it added.

Nyon, Switzerlaand-based UEFA pointed to this in its statement that the ruling “does not signify an endorsement or validation” of the Super League plan.

“It rather underscores a pre-existing shortfall within UEFA’s pre-authorisation framework, a technical aspect that has already been acknowledged and addressed in June 2022,” the federation said. “UEFA is confident in the robustness of its new rules, and specifically that they comply with all relevant European laws and regulations.”

The ruling was part of a trio of sports cases at the Luxembourg-based tribunal that all cast doubt on the ability of governing bodies to dictate how indivual athletes and teams operate.

UEFA bylaws aimed at encouraging locally trained young talent could also violate E.U. competition rules, E.U. judges ruled in a second sports case on Thursday. The ruling is in line with the opinion of a court adviser who said earlier this year the rules may be unfairly allowing top clubs to snap up the best players in their region.

The court said it’s up to national tribunals to rule on the specifics of this case.

In yet another setback for sports governing bodies, E.U. judges on Thursday rejected a challenge by the International Skating Union of E.U. regulators who found that the union’s threat to ban a pair of Dutch speed skaters from the Winter Olympics for taking part in unauthorized events, violated antitrust rules.

The case was sparked by the federation’s threat to ban a pair of Dutch speed skaters from the Winter Olympics for taking part in unauthorized events. The court said that the union’s rules give it “a clear advantage over its competitors and have unfavorable effects for athletes as well as consumers and broadcast audiences.”

The cases are: C-333/21 European Superleague Company; C-124/21 P International Skating Union v. Commission, C-680/21 Royal Antwerp Football Club.'",sports,soccer

"'Ben Roethlisberger led the Steelers to the Super Bowl in just his second season in the NFL. This was Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance and the Seahawks were down on the scoreboard 14-3 after Willie Parker's 75-yard touchdown run early in the second half. With 6:04 left in regulation, this was still a 14-10 game in Pittsburgh's favor.

"'WILLIAMS — It was just before 8 a.m. on a clear fall day when trucks carrying fire crews barreled down dirt roads into Kaibab National Forest.

Shortly after, the crews began to set over 2,300 acres of the ponderosa pine ecosystem ablaze.

The Kendrick Prescribed Fire Project was one of the first of many prescribed burns this fall and winter throughout Arizona with the goal of protecting forest lands and surrounding communities from the threat of potentially catastrophic wildfires.

The prescribed burns in Kaibab National Forest are part of the U.S. Forest Service’s 10-year wildfire crisis strategy, which aims to combat wildfires in high-risk forest landscapes.

The strategy began in January 2022 as a response to the growing threat of wildfires in the West over the past 20 years due to climate change, accumulating fuels and development. It emphasizes the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems, which rely on regular fire exposure to stay healthy.

In other words, the Forest Service aims to fight fire with fire.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, the Forest Service will receive $5 billion over 10 years, including $1.8 billion that will be used to increase forest treatments in 11 new landscapes across Western states. Those treatments include prescribed burns.

Preventing catastrophic wildfires

Prescribed burns are a wildfire prevention method that involves burning an area of land in a controlled manner in order to minimize the risk of future catastrophic wildfires.

“The objective of many of these prescribed fires is to reduce forest fuels in the area,” said Zach Boness, burn boss for the prescribed burns in Kaibab National Forest. “We live in a fire-dependent ecosystem in northern Arizona, and so fire is part of how these trees remain healthy, how the forest remains healthy.”

“Forest fuels” refer to anything in the forest that can burn, including dead plants, dead trees, built-up leaves and pine needles. If these materials aren’t burned away in a controlled manner, they can build up and become fuel for dangerous wildfires, causing them to spread quickly and burn longer, making it difficult for fire crews to contain a wildfire once it starts.

In areas like the Kaibab forest, wildfires are often started by lightning strikes. When there is a lot of fuel on the forest floor, the fires can spread quickly.

Areas that have been pre-burned, though, don’t burn as intensely and often won’t burn at all since the forest fuels have already been burned off, according to Bob Blasi, a Kaibab National Forest fire information officer.

“A raging fire headed straight towards a pre-treated area will usually just go and drop,” Blasi said. “Wildfires can stop dead in their tracks, literally, when they hit a pre-treated piece of ground like this.”

According to Blasi, once a piece of land has burned, it likely won’t burn again for another 10 to 15 years.

“We do have empirical evidence that speaks to the effectiveness of these prescribed fires and other fuels treatments in slowing down and allowing us to be more successful when fire suppression is required,” Boness said.

Environmental benefits

The ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona rely on regular fire exposure to encourage biodiversity.

“When you don’t have fires frequently, then the forests get very dense,” said Andrea Thode, a professor of fire ecology and fire science in the School of Forestry at Northern Arizona University. “The trees are very close together, they don’t grow in diameter and they don’t get a lot bigger.”

When there is an excess amount of trees, the amount of forest fuels on the ground increases, making it difficult for native plant species to flourish. Additionally, when the canopy of trees is thicker, less sunlight can reach the ground to encourage photosynthesis.

Where plants struggle to grow, wildlife struggles to live. Species such as elk rely on the forbs, grasses and shrubs that grow in the ponderosa pine forests, but when forests are dense, they aren’t able to access their food supply.

Prescribed burns help manage forest density and burn off the build-up of fuels on the ground, allowing for more plants to grow. Additionally, when a prescribed fire burns through an area and blackens the trunks of trees, it leaves behind ash rich in minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen, Thode said. These minerals then soak into the soil on the ground and boost the plant growth.

Prescribed burns help ensure that these minerals can soak into the ground.

“At certain temperatures, nitrogen will volatilize, so it goes from that solid state to a gaseous state and is lost to the system,” Thode said, “but with low-severity fires, it’s released and so you do get an ash that has a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus in it.”

Thode said that even species that tend to prefer living in denser forest ecosystems benefit from prescribed burns. Mexican spotted owls, a threatened species that resides in northern Arizona forests, roost in dense groups of trees, but they require more open areas when hunting for food.

“Removing the more continuous fuels, making (forests) more heterogeneous landscapes, changes the way that fire can move through that landscape to protect those areas, even if they do need to be more dense where the owls are nesting,” Thode said.

Prescribed burns do produce smoke, which releases carbon into the atmosphere, but according to Thode, it’s much less intense and harmful than the smoke from a catastrophic wildfire.

“It’s not really if it’s going to burn,” Thode said. “It’s when it’s going to burn and how it’s going to burn.”

The process of prescribed burns

These burns are planned months ahead of time. Early aspects of planning include organizing crews, planning burn locations, developing prescriptions, organizing permits and informing the public.

“There’s more to it than just a bunch of cavemen dragging drip torches around,” Blasi said. “It’s a very detailed organization, and it requires a lot of experience level from the top all the way to the bottom.”

Specialists also develop a burn plan, or “prescription.” This prescription takes into account weather, environmental risks and location to determine the best conditions for a burn.

Then, crews head to the location to begin preparing. They prepare bulldozer lines, which are clear areas that act as barriers for a particular burn, and they clear out some of the harder-to-remove excess fuels with saws so that the burns are easier to control.

While plans are determined ahead of time, they are often subject to change due to the unpredictability of factors like weather and humidity.

“We’re prepping right up until the day of, making sure we have the resources that are needed and getting folks in place for all that,” Boness said.

On the day of, crews begin by gathering at a morning briefing led by burn bosses. Boness was the burn boss in charge of the prescribed burns in the Kaibab National Forest, aided by burn boss trainee Ryan Allen.

“We’re ultimately the ones in charge of the operations out here on our prescribed fire,” Boness said. “We coordinate with both our firing group and our holding group as well as coordinating between the agency administrator and our other overhead personnel to make sure we’re answering questions and that all the permits are in place, that all of our bases are covered so that we’re following our policy.”

At the briefing on Oct. 5, Boness and Allen went over the plans for the day’s burn to make sure everyone from each crew was on the same page and knew where they were assigned.

After the briefing comes the test fire, where the burn bosses observe a small, controlled fire to ensure that the forest conditions will allow for it to burn the way they want it to.

“If that’s successful for us, if we see that we’re meeting our conditions, meeting our prescribed fire window, then we’ll continue with our general ignitions,” Boness said.

Following a successful test fire, the fire crews get to work. Ground crews first “blackline” the area set to burn, using drip torches to ignite thin lines of fire on the outer edges to act as a barrier preventing fires from spreading outside the prescribed area.

Then, a helicopter equipped with a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) drops small fireballs, no larger than a ping-pong ball, inside the perimeter to burn the area quickly and efficiently while putting fewer workers at risk.

As the PSD operator for the prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, Christian Cortes was in charge of releasing four to five fireballs per acre. Inside the PSD machine, the balls are injected with ethylene glycol, which causes them to ignite once they hit the ground.

“It’s like an art; there’s a certain way to do it to avoid balls from flying all over the place or losing control of anything,” Cortes said.

Throughout the prescribed burn process, safety is a priority, Blasi said. As firing crews lay down blacklines and the helicopter drops fireballs, holding crews drive trucks around the edges of burn areas to make sure that fire isn’t jumping from already burned “black” areas into unburned “green” areas. If they see a spot where the fire has jumped across the line, they put it out. Fires are continuously monitored as they burn through the night.

Additionally, each burn is assigned an air resource adviser and meteorologist. The adviser from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality monitors the smoke to determine health risks while the meteorologist helps ensure that the burns are safe to complete under current weather conditions.

Sometimes, areas are completely blocked off during prescribed burns for the safety of the public. The prescribed burns in the Kaibab forest, though, were deemed safe enough to allow people to drive next to where the fires were burning.

“We use it mostly for an opportunity to educate people,” Blasi said. “We want them to come up close to see it, we want them to understand why it’s important.”

Lindsay Nava, a recent graduate from NAU, said that the Forest Service’s work with prescribed burns is part of what inspired her to get involved in fire control. She has worked as a crewmember on various prescribed burn projects for the past year.'",climate,forest fire
"'United States v Duke - Credit: Lance King/Getty Images

Brittney Griner’s imprisonment in Russia and subsequent release will be the focus of both an upcoming documentary and scripted television series.

The WNBA star has partnered with Disney’s ESPN and ABC Signature on the projects, with the former producing the documentary and the latter planning the scripted series.

More from Rolling Stone

Griner — who, like other WNBA athletes, played basketball in Russia during the offseason — was arrested in February 2022 after two cannabis vape cartridges were discovered in her carry-on luggage. Though Griner claimed she packed the cartridges by mistake, she pleaded guilty to drug smuggling charges and was eventually sentenced to nine years in prison. However, Griner’s release was secured with a one-for-one prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022, 10 months after her arrest.

Following the ordeal, Griner returned to the WNBA and the US national basketball team, but was still the target of a “calculated confrontation” by a “social media figure and provocateur” in a Dallas airport this past June.

“The last two years have been the most harrowing, transformative and illuminating period of my life, and I am grateful to be in a place now to share my story with the world,” Griner said of the projects in a statement. “I’m proud to partner with ESPN and Disney to share this very personal story because of its incredible potential to inspire hope around the world and their proven ability to do just that.”

Prior to the documentary and TV series, Griner will sit down for an exclusive ABC News interview with Robin Roberts, the Hollywood Reporter writes. Griner also previously revealed plans to pen a memoir about her ordeal.

"'A wind whipped fire in Mingo County from Sunday is one of more than 100 burning in the state. PHOTO: Jason Nelson

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The low humidity, warmer temperatures, and the steady wind in recent days has turned the West Virginia forest and the new leaf litter on the forest floor into a potential tinder box.

As of Monday, the West Virginia Division of Forestry reported more than 100 forest fires in the state and Deputy State Forester Tony Evans believed the number was well beyond.

“Over the weekend we’ve had so many firs that have popped up, we definitively know we have more than that,” said Evans.

Some of the fires were large in scale.

“We have several big fires. One down in McDowell County is several hundred acres. Raleigh County’s got a big fire Kanawha has a couple. Boone County has several fires that are going to be several hundred acres, same thing with Mingo County,” he explained.

According to Evans, the Southern West Virginia topography lends itself well to a wildfire and they tend to get out of control faster in the steep hills of the coalfields than in other parts of the state. The terrain also makes them more difficult to put out.

The fires are so widespread, Evans said they are asking people stop calling 911 with just reports of seeing or smelling smoke. Since those kind of reports are too vague to help pinpoint a fire.

“Unless they see an actual fire or a big column of smoke coming up from a specific place, don’t call 911 just if they are seeing or smelling smoke in the air,” he explained..

The Kanawha County Commission penned a letter to the Division of Forestry asking for a total burning ban until some measurable rainfall comes. Evans said that decision would have to come from the Governor’s office.

The fall forest fire rules are in effect, meaning that any outdoor burning must be done between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. However, under the present conditions, Evans said use common sense.

“You know if it’s dry and windy, wait until we get some moisture. It doesn’t take very much for the wind to pick up an ember and put it out into the woods or dry grass and we have a forest fire,” he said.'",climate,heatwave

"'One of Quebec’s youngest mayors announced on Nov. 8 she will be stepping down next week, suffering the effects of burnout from handling last summer’s historic wildfire season in her northern community.

Isabelle Lessard was acclaimed in 2021 as mayor of Chapais, Que., a town of just over 1,500 people, located 400 kilometres northwest of Quebec City.

The 23-year-old said on Nov. 8 that her resignation is effective Nov. 17, about halfway through her mandate. She has been on a leave since mid-September, after shepherding Chapais through one of the worst forest fire seasons on record.

In an interview with The Canadian Press, Ms. Lessard said she feels unable to complete her term and is at risk of developing post-traumatic stress syndrome.

“Even if I was at 100 percent when it was time to return to work, the workload was going to be enormous because I have been absent for a bit,” Ms. Lessard said.

“I saw it happening and I said to myself: I don’t think I’m going to have managed to build myself up strong enough to be able to face it.”

At the beginning of June, two-thirds of the residents of Ms. Lessard’s community were forced from their homes for several days as wildfires closed in. The community was on high alert in the weeks that followed.

She said that before going on leave, she was sleeping poorly and felt constantly stressed. She also felt anger—first over the unprecedented forest fire situation and then at herself for not being strong enough.

She doesn’t think this is the end of her time in public life.

“Yes, I’m leaving two years later, but I still have my life ahead of me, and maybe it’s not the end of politics for me,“ Ms. Lessard said. ”I think I need to take a step back.”

Ms. Lessard said she realizes the message from her decision might be seen as contradictory for younger generations looking to her as inspiration for entering politics, but she encouraged them to take the leap, all the while being mindful of their own health.

“I think you just have to be aware of those battles,” she said of taking care of mental health issues.

Ms. Lessard acknowledged that finding a replacement as mayor could be difficult in the small community.

The Union des Municipalités du Québec, an organization representing towns and cities across the province, paid tribute to Ms. Lessard on Nov. 8.

“Isabelle gave her body and soul for her community, it is now her turn to take care of herself,” the organization’s president, Martin Damphousse, said in a statement.

“Her decision seriously reminds us that municipal officials are, above all, human beings, the challenges and crises they face are increasingly complex and also reveal the importance of their role.”'",climate,forest fire
"'Massive wildfires in Canada, Greece and Hawaii. All-time record heat waves. Hurricanes with surprising ferocity, like the one that devastated Acapulco last week.

This year has presented stark evidence that Earth is already in “uncharted territory” with climate change, scientists say, to the point that unless major progress is made to reduce greenhouse emissions, parts of the world that are home to one-third to one-half of the global population could face extreme heat, food shortages and water shortages by the end of this century.

That’s the conclusion of a new study from researchers at Oregon State University and other institutions around the world, that has been drawing growing attention since its publication last week.

“As scientists, we are increasingly being asked to tell the public the truth about the crises we face in simple and direct terms,” the researchers wrote. “The truth is that we are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme weather events in 2023. We are afraid of the uncharted territory that we have now entered.”

Of 35 vital signs of planetary health, 20 are at record levels, and most in an environmentally harmful way, the scientists concluded. Although renewable energy is increasing and rainforest depletion is slowing, ocean acidity, glacier thickness, and Greenland’s ice mass all fell to record lows over the past two years, while greenhouse gas emissions, sea level rise and ocean temperatures rose to record highs.

What’s needed is a much faster phase-out of coal, oil and other fossil fuels, the researchers said in the study, which was published in the journal Bioscience. They also recommended increased protections for the world’s forests, more people eating plant-based diets, financial assistance to help the poorest countries deal with extreme weather disasters, and more family planning and women’s education to voluntarily slow population growth.

“We are in dire straits but it’s not too late,” said William Ripple, lead author of the paper and a professor at the Oregon State University College of Forestry. “The work we do now will make a huge difference.”

Global temperatures have risen 2.1 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, mostly due to the burning of fossil fuels, which traps heat in the atmosphere. The 10 warmest years on Earth since 1850, when consistent modern temperature records began, have all occurred since 2010, according to NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is the parent agency of the National Weather Service.

This June through August was the warmest such period ever recorded, with record low levels of Antarctic sea ice. Many climate researchers say 2023 could break another record for the hottest year on record.

Some significant environmental shifts are underway. This year in California, 25% of all new car sales are electric — nearly three times the national average. Washington state is second, at 18% and Oregon is third at 17%.

Meanwhile, California is also breaking records every year in renewable energy use. In 2021, 37% of the state’s electricity was generated by renewable sources such as solar and wind — more than double the 16% in 2012, according to new numbers released this summer by the California Energy Commission.

When nuclear power and hydroelectricity from large dams are included, 59% of California’s electricity now comes from carbon-free sources. The state has a goal of 90% by 2035 and 100% by 2045.

“I agree that the climate crisis is deeply serious and that progress in tackling it is much too slow,” said biologist Chris Field, director of Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment. “Still, we are seeing impressive progress in some areas.”

Field noted that the price for solar and wind energy continues to fall, the performance of electric vehicles is growing, and more large corporations have pledged to reach “net zero emissions.”

Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring all corporations that operate in California with more than $1 billion in revenue to annually report their greenhouse gas emissions — a first-in the nation law that will include companies from Chevron to McDonald’s, and allow the public to see who are the biggest polluters.

“We need to find the political and economic will to dramatically accelerate the pace of change,” Field said.

On his first day in office in 2021, President Biden signed an order committing the United States to re-enter the Paris Climate Agreement, a compromise among more than 190 nations to cut fossil fuel emissions that former President Trump had pulled out of. Biden also pledged for the U.S. to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030, and signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark bill that included $369 billion in tax breaks and incentives for solar, wind, electric vehicle production, battery charging stations and other climate investments. Biden appointed Michael Regan, a former vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Trump, who is challenging Biden in next year’s election, appointed Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, to run the EPA when he was president. He attempted to expand offshore oil drilling along the California coast and in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, called climate change “a hoax,” and incorrectly stated that wind turbines cause cancer.

Traditionally, scientists have been encouraged by universities to publish findings in scientific journals but not do much outreach to the general public or political leaders, said Ripple, the Oregon State scientist. But that’s changing.

“Scientists are starting to do a much better job of warning humanity of these major threats,” he said. “It’s very much needed for scientists to speak out.”'",climate,forest fire

Two significant earthquakes jolted Nepal on Monday, just three days after a powerful temblor killed more than 150 people in the Himalayan nation. A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Nepal on Monday, centered in the Jajarkot district about 250 miles northeast of the capital, Kathmandu, which was hit hard by the magnitude 5.6 earthquake on Friday.

At least 153 people were killed by that first quake, according to the latest official figures from Nepalese authorities on Monday, which was a slightly lower toll than provided over the weekend. More than 339 people were also injured.

A 4.5-magnitude aftershock hit the western part of the country just nine minutes after the earthquake on Monday, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre said. At least three people sustained minor injuries but there were no reports of any deaths from the Monday temblors, according to Jajarkot police official Satosh Rokka.

Jajarkot district official Ek Raj Upadhayay said buildings damaged by Friday's quake may have been further compromised, but no details were available. Nepal's Jajarkot and Rukum districts, both mountainous and home to many far-flung villages, were the worst hit by Friday's earthquake.

Most of the roughly 8,000 homes in the region were damaged, authorities said, and in some cases entire families were left buried under the rubble.

Survivors said they heard loud noises as buildings collapsed soon after the Friday quake. Many people were still sleeping outdoors in the cold after the earthquake flattened their homes and they remained in dire need of aid.

There were shortages of all necessities, including food and medicine, as relief materials and rescue teams were just starting to reach several locations in the earthquake zone Monday, according to local media.

Nepalese authorities have struggled to get aid into the remote areas as roads were also blocked by landslides triggered by the earthquake.

Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Purna Bahadur Khadka said Sunday that the government was prioritizing medical aid, relief and rehabilitation for earthquake survivors, as thousands were left homeless overnight.

The earthquakes, which struck as many people were asleep in their homes, were felt in India's capital, New Delhi, more than 500 miles away.

Research from the University of Warwick has found that national parks and protected areas are at a higher risk of forest fires when located farther away from indigenous communities.

Based on the analysis of satellite images from Thailand and case studies from other Southeast Asian countries, the research demonstrates that policymakers can achieve improvements in forest health by working collaboratively with indigenous communities. Involving communities results in reduction of forest fires and air pollution.

Ivo Vlaev, Professor of Behavioral Science at Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick says that current green policies in Thailand do not take into account that indigenous communities have long-standing traditions and sustainable practices for protecting the land.

""Globally, Indigenous peoples' lands cover over 36% of intact forest landscapes, making them crucial for mitigating severe climate change. We also know that the loss of intact forest landscapes has been significantly lower on indigenous lands compared to other areas.

""Current green policies exclude local communities from using the forest and at the same time prevents them from implementing effective environmental management practices, such as community forestry, tree ordination (a symbolic Buddhist ritual which involves wrapping orange robes to help people view them as sacred and therefore prevent logging and deforestation), forest fire monitoring, and animal grazing—all of which have been proven to protect forest cover.""

The Mae Sa Noi village in the Chiang Mai highlands in Thailand is home to a Hmong community. The villagers have successfully instilled ancient Hmong rituals which involve annual celebrations for a deity believed to be inhabiting the sacred tong seng tree in the forest.

Co-author of the research, Dr. Marco J Haenssgen from Chiang Mai University, Thailand is in close contact with the community through his work. He says, ""The purpose of these celebrations is to strengthen the protection of the forest while also showcasing the community's commitment to the natural environment to the local authorities who are also invited to these events.""

The Hmong community has experienced competition for natural resources after the state promoted rural development initiatives in order to diversify agriculture away from opium production in the 1960s. Subsequently, stringent forest protection enforcement led to arrests and fines throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

""After experiencing these conditions for many years, the community is facing widespread outmigration of young people, volatility of agricultural markets, and even challenges around food security,"" continues Dr. Haenssgen.

Thai conservation law currently stands in contrast to the global policy direction that aims to support indigenous livelihoods and preserve terrestrial areas. Some policies meant to prevent deforestation actually have the opposite effect by displacing indigenous people and pushing them into more intensive land use, such as cash-cropping which sees continuous cultivation of crops using harmful chemical fertilizers.

""Policymakers need to recognize the value strong communities play in healthy environments and communities need space and the right to thrive sustainably,"" says Professor Vlaev.

""It's not just about giving indigenous people a fair share of the economy, it is about implementing green policies which are actually effective. Several countries have successfully worked with indigenous communities to develop inclusive conservation policies.""

Countries such as Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Norway and Malaysia have involved communities in policy decision-making and achieved sustainable outcomes while respecting indigenous rights.

Recommendations for inclusive forest conservation policies

Academics say Thailand can learn lessons from the experiences of other countries and set out a series of practical recommendations to develop effective sustainable policies and enhance forest conservation:

Implement flexible laws and regulations that consider the specific needs and aspirations of Indigenous communities. The Royal Forestry Department holds the responsibility to create designated zones where Indigenous peoples have the right to manage and utilize forest resources following their traditional practices. This area may extend further into national park territory than presently. Providing a legal framework for Indigenous communities to assert their rights over ancestral lands and resources can also contribute to sustainable forest management.

Establish collaborative arrangements involving local communities to co-care for forest land. Involving indigenous communities in forest fire prevention, waste collection, and other activities will enhance their sense of ownership and motivation to protect and conserve the forest.

Ensure land protection rights and secure tenure for Indigenous communities. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security play key roles in strengthening measures to safeguard these rights and address land conflicts. Additionally, establishing social insurance schemes and promoting welfare benefits can improve the social and economic well-being of Indigenous communities, reducing pressure on agricultural production.

Thailand can encourage consumers to support highland communities by labeling products sourced from them, produced under culturally protected and sustainable indigenous practices. The Thai Food and Drug Administration ensures compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, supporting sustainable production methods and quality. The Royal Project Foundation, a major agricultural-environmental development organization, can also support food labeling as a market-based initiative. ""No-burn"" labels can be used to signify that this agriculturist has not practiced crop burning that is responsible for air pollution.

Thailand should streamline and expedite the process of issuing land titles to recognize their customary land rights, to join the rest of the world in recognizing the capabilities of Indigenous people.

The Ministries of Culture, Interior, Social development and Human Development have a central role in promoting cultural diversity and enforcing Indigenous cultural freedom, thereby helping Thailand expand the special cultural zones that provide legal protection and recognition for Indigenous cultures and traditions. These zones should be designed to preserve and promote Indigenous languages, knowledge systems, and cultural practices, yet with a focus on everyday heritage rather than locking communities into ""traditions"" that are bound to evolve.'",climate,forest fire
"'Revealed in 2022, get ready for an inspiring adventure with a demonic hero, featuring a vast world to explore full of secrets, visceral action, and explosive vehicular combat.

Dive into a desert world where both humans and demons suffer from an extreme water shortage. Play as and watch the Fiend Prince, Beelzebub, Sheriff Rao, and demon Thief set off on an adventure in search of a Legendary Spring hidden in the desert. Introducing himself as a “super evil fiend”, Beelzebub has a pure heart like a little boy but has superhuman strength and telepathic abilities. Rao, a small-town sheriff, seeks the aid of demons to save all of Sand Land from the water shortage. Thief, a wise old demon with thieving abilities also accompanies Beelzebub and Rao on their adventure.

Playing as Beelzebub, players will be able to explore a vast world accompanied by his unlikely group of demons and humans. Whether roaming in various vehicles, or traveling by foot, players will encounter dangers as well as helpful characters they meet in the vast desert while uncovering SAND LAND’s many secrets. Vehicular and character combat is a big part of the action in the game. Players will have access to a variety of vehicles that they can customize and equip with loadouts to traverse the desert, overcome obstacles, and take on a diverse assortment of mighty foes.

For players in the West, it’s time to meet the English VO cast that are bringing Beelzebub and his rag-tag crew to life. An updated story trailer released today by Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc. highlights the voices of the cast and gives a glimpse at another key moment from the game, where the crew is searching for the Legendary Spring – a prophesied body of water that would provide drinking water to the desert wasteland and save its inhabitants from the greed of the water-hoarding King of Sand Land. Sand Land characters are brought to life for English speaking fans by the following talented cast of VO actors: Beelzebub (voiced by Risa Mei) The Fiend Prince himself is taking to the desert wastelands in search of water. Though typically seeks the latest video games or the perfect prank to play on his friends, Beelzebub is taking on a more heroic role with Rao to help all the inhabitants of the wasteland. Rao (voiced by John Lipow) Sporting a jaunty hat paired with a mean pair of shorts and knee-high socks to complete his off duty but ready for action look, Rao is one of the good guys. Tired of seeing his fellow humans suffer under the King of Sand Land’s water hoarding, it’s Rao who seeks out the help of the demons to try and find fresh water. Thief (voiced by Owen Thomas) One of Beelzebub’s loyal advisors and a crafty demon in general, Thief naturally has a penchant for stealing. But on top of his sticky fingers, Thief is also as strong as he is wise. He can use his cunning intellect to help the group overcome any obstacle in their path. Lucifer (voiced by Keith Silverstein): Beelzebub’s father and the king of all demons, Lucifer is the one spurring on Beelzebub to take on Rao’s request (and forbidding him from playing video games until he finishes his tasks). General Are (voiced by Andrew Lander) As one of the top soldiers in the Sand Land Royal Army, General Are is a persistent thorn in the side of Rao. Supreme Commander Zeu (voiced by Shawn Smith): Players will have to learn more about Supreme Commander Zeu as they progress through the story, but it would be safe to assume that Zeu is one bad dude.

The Chicago Sky have reportedly found their next head coach, and it will be a familiar name for basketball fans.

According to Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium, the Sky are ""finalizing a deal"" to make Basketball Hall of Famer Teresa Weatherspoon the head coach. While Weatherspoon is best known as a WNBA legend, she has also been an assistant coach for the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans the past four years.

Chicago won the WNBA championship in 2021 and finished with a 26-10 record in 2022, but the 2023 campaign was a tumultuous one for the franchise.

Franchise icons in Candace Parker (Las Vegas Aces) and Courtney Vandersloot (New York Liberty) signed elsewhere before the season, while sharp-shooter Allie Quigley decided to take the year off.

What's more, James Wade stepped down as head coach and general manager after 16 games to join the Toronto Raptors in an assistant coaching role. The Sky turned toward Emre Vatansever in an interim capacity.

The end result was a disappointing 18-22 record and first-round exit in the postseason.

Now the hope is WNBA greatness can turn things around as soon as the 2024 season.

Weatherspoon played for the Liberty and Los Angeles Sparks from 1997 through 2004 and was a five-time All-Star who helped usher in the start of a new league. She was a defensive star and excellent ball-handler who was a leader for the Liberty for much of her career.

Following her playing career, Weatherspoon became the head coach of Louisiana Tech's women's basketball team and then the director of player and franchise development for the Liberty.

"'Researchers believe the people who drew up the original Colorado River Compact ignored good science on how much water actually flows down the river annually.

(CN) — A century ago, seven men formed a commission to decide how water from the Colorado River should be divvied up, basing their allocations on estimates of 16.4 million acre-feet of flow per year. The trouble was — and continues to be — the estimate was wrong.

Today, biological sciences professor Shemin Ge and her colleagues at the University of Colorado Boulder hope decisions made over 100 years ago can be looked at in new light with lesser-known information made and will talk about at a historical presentation in Colorado titled ""Learning from History in Reallocating the Colorado River.""

“It would be very helpful not to repeat the mistakes in the past to bring science to the table for the discussion,” she said.

Ge and her team offer a historical perspective on the issue and how the over 100-year-old Colorado River Compact might have overestimated the amount of water the river could provide — estimates that were not backed by current surveys or research, she said. They presented their findings Thursday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.

In the early 1900s, the middle section of the Colorado River Basin was one of the most remote and inaccessible regions, making water measurements very difficult to obtain.

At the time, the Colorado River Commission estimated 16.4-million-acre-feet of river discharge annually at Lee Ferry, based on stream discharge measurements at Laguna Diversion Dam near Yuma, Arizona.

But in 1916, U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist Eugene Clyde La Rue had calculated a lower estimate of 15.0 million acre-feet per year after traveling hundreds of miles of the Colorado River and its tributaries between 1914 and 1924. This difference accounts for almost 10% of the river discharge assumed by the men who signed the compact in 1922 and even falls short of the estimated reduction in demand needed to address the current shortage. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has said Colorado River Basin states needed to reduce consumption by 2 to 4 million acre-feet in 2023 to protect hydropower generation at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, according to Ge.

The Colorado River Compact has led to a water shortage crisis, with water levels at Mead and Powell reaching historic lows and threatening water supply, hydropower and ecosystems. The water shortages in the Colorado River basin are often attributed to climate change, population growth, and reduced precipitation, but the 1922 commission's decision to ignore hydrologic science during the negotiation of the original compact is a significant factor. As discussions continue and planners negotiate a new compact, they must avoid repeating the same mistakes today, Ge said.

“I think the states and the government are working towards a better agreement for the future,” Ge said in an interview. “So, I think it's important to bring scientists to the table with all parties within the basin to the table. Fifty years ago, or even just 100 is at that time they didn't have much to work with. They know the advanced technology.”

Various interested parties, beyond water researchers and managers, share concerns about the issue, Ge said, including the 29 Native American tribes who live along the river.

“And yet because of lack of infrastructure to use, to take the water where it's needed in the tribal nations, and it's just very hard for them to use,” said Ge.

According to Ge, the time for change is now.

“Many of my colleagues, they didn't know,” Ge said of La Rue’s findings. “I think it is important to spread the words and to disseminate what we learned from the history.”'",climate,drought
"'Extreme, severe drought conditions expand in NC, Cape Fear in moderate drought

RALEIGH, NC (PRESS RELEASE) – Light rain did not halt the expansion of drought across the state, with the North Carolina’s Drought Management Advisory Council expanding the Extreme Drought designation to parts of four additional counties in southwestern North Carolina, and classifying 10 more counties in the Piedmont as in Severe Drought.

Brunswick, Bladen, Columbus, New Hanover, and Pender Counties are all in the moderate drought classification.

The new classifications released Wednesday account for precipitation that occurred as of 8 a.m. Tuesday, but most of the state saw less than a tenth of an inch, said Klaus Albertin, chair of DMAC. Mid-week rainfall would be reflected in next week’s drought update. Albertin said the additional precipitation could help prevent conditions from worsening.

“Typically, rain for this time a year is about an inch a week,” Albertin said. “If we get an inch and a half, it could help, but may not improve conditions dramatically. The mid- to long-term forecast is still for a wet winter due to the El Niño pattern, but it’s expected to be January before we start to see big impacts.”

In western North Carolina, DMAC expanded the Extreme Drought classification to Burke, Jackson, Lincoln and Swain counties, in addition to Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Graham, Henderson, Macon, Polk, Rutherford and Transylvania counties. Under Extreme Drought, all water users are advised to follow their Water Shortage Response Plans, adhering to guidelines established during the 2007 drought. Water systems in areas of extreme drought are required to report weekly water usage.

The DMAC also expanded the Severe Drought classification for an additional 10 counties in central North Carolina, encompassing 40 total counties. Until further notice, DMAC strongly urges local government implementation of drought response actions – in addition to previous advisories – for all water users located in, or dependent on, water resources from the areas of the state in Severe Drought conditions. Recommendations include examining water delivery systems to minimize loss and maximize efficiency, eliminating non-essential water use and evaluating options for reuse, reclamation and/or recycling into daily operations.

In addition, abnormally dry (D0) to moderate (D1) drought conditions continued in eastern North Carolina. Across the state, all of or parts of 96 counties were classified as abnormally dry or worse.

DMAC’s drought map is updated weekly on Thursdays. The next map update will be on Nov. 30. To learn more, visit https://www.ncdrought.org/education.'",climate,drought
"'Sony Interactive Entertainment has shared a list of the top PS5, PS4 games in 2023 based on hours played, and it’s just what one would expect. Free-to-play and battle royale titles reign supreme across the board, with only one or two countries slightly deviating from the trend.

Top PS5, PS4 games of 2023 around the globe by hours played between January 1 and November 30, 2023

Fortnite was the number one most popular game in nearly every country except for Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and Colombia.

"'As Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James gears up for the 2023-24 NBA season, the WNBA season has come to an end. The 2023 WNBA Champions were officially crowned on Wednesday night, when A’ja Wilson and the Las Vegas Aces stormed back to defeat the New York Liberty and secure their second consecutive title. With 24 points and 16 rebounds, Wilson tallied her first WNBA Finals MVP.

Wilson has already won two regular season MVP awards and has quickly become one of the most decorated players in WNBA history at 27 years old. She has enough accolades to last a lifetime, but clearly has no interest in slowing down. The South Carolina native is only adding to her impressive collection.

And James, the Lakers star and one of basketball’s most powerful figures, teased something new for Wilson’s ledger, a signature shoe, via Oruny Choi of Complex:

“Signature shoe coming!!” LeBron James teasing Nike’s next signature athlete: A’ja Wilson She won Finals MVP and her second title wearing a special Nike LeBron 21 PE. pic.twitter.com/RN5FkNaf6j — Oruny (@OrunyChoi) October 19, 2023

Wilson accepted that first Finals MVP award while wearing a pair of James’ signature shoes. It was after posting a dominant performance to lead the Aces in an impressive comeback victory. The James shoe she wore was a special edition LeBron 21 PE.

It’s an incredible moment for both James and Wilson. For James, he gets to see one of the inarguable best players in the last generation of women’s basketball wear his shoes, one of many signals of his impact on the basketball world.

Wilson, meanwhile, gets to add a collaboration with one of the greatest men’s basketball players of all time to her already incredible pro career. Nike sneaker fans should be anxiously awaiting the arrival of Wilson’s first signature shoe.

Austin Reaves wants to tell kids he won title with James

Another sign of the impact James has had on the basketball world is comments from James’ own teammate, Lakers guard Austin Reaves.

Reaves has already begun cementing himself as a starting-caliber player in the NBA and figures to play arguably the third largest role on a championship-contending team.

But his goal this season is nothing personal, it’s to win a championship so that he has the ability to tell his future children that he won a championship next to James. LeBron leading L.A. to a championship in his 21st season would be among his most impressive feats in a nearly flawless Hall of Fame career.

"'ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - Many remember November 4, 1985, as a day of chaos in Southwest Virginia as flood waters quickly submerged our hometowns.

Roanoke residents were left in a state of confusion as flood waters swept away buildings, cars, and relics of a place they called home. Many were forced to evacuate, not knowing for certain what they would return to. Others found themselves trapped within flood waters, awaiting rescue from first responders.

62 people in Southwest Virginia and West Virginia would lose their lives, 10 of whom from Roanoke.

Those who fled their homes in Roanoke went to places of refuge hosted by the Salvation Army, including the Salem Civic Center, Patrick Henry High School, and Breckenridge Junior High.

One of the 280 people who stayed at the Salem Civic Center, Jesse Sewell, explained his grief. “I’m a grown man and I don’t like to cry but I can’t help it in this particular case,” he said.

First responders were met with many challenges to reach those who were in dire situations, as they too had to trek across impassible routes to reach those in need. The public was asked not to call first responders unless they were in extreme and urgent danger, due to a backlog of call responses.

WDBJ7 even made a helicopter rescue while gathering footage of the flood. Former Delegate Vic Thomas, his son Eric, his legislative aide, and a customer carrying his 4-year-old son were on top of the roof of a building. Photographer Mark Layman and Pilot Carl Milko quickly rescued the group as Lifeguard 10 was responding to nearby calls. 90 seconds after their rescue, the building was swept away.

Watch the full interview on the helicopter rescue with Eric Thomas by WDBJ7′s Joe Dashiell below.

The city was in urgent need, and a looming concern for first responders and Roanoke City officials regarded the state of the Roanoke Memorial Hospital, now known as Carilion Roanoke Memorial. The hospital lost power in all areas except the west wing, where patients in critical condition were transported quickly. Officials feared that the rising waters in the basement would seep into the electrical wiring, leaving the entire building without power, light, heat, or telephone service.

Firefighters rapidly pumped out 750 gallons of water a minute in an attempt to drain the six feet of water that remained. Nurses and students lined up dining trays and buckets along the stairwell to prevent the further spread of water within the building. As flood conditions didn’t let up, the hospital staff prepared to assist patients without power, deciding against evacuating the building.

Roanoke City Manager at the time, Bob Herbert, estimated the flood damage in Roanoke alone was roughly $115 to $125 million, which is equal to half a billion dollars in 2023. The Downtown Roanoke exit off of 460 was under six feet of water and resembled more a canal than a road, with many buildings only being accessible by boat.

Roanoke County Schools such as Northside High School closed their doors and students stayed the night in the building due to dangerous road conditions. Other schools delayed dismissal, waiting for the go-ahead from city officials to approve bus routes.

Many were stuck at a location that was a part of their daily routine, such as school or work, unaware that they would spend many hours stranded away from home.

C&P, now known as Verizon, and ConTel Phone Companies urged the public to refrain from making phone calls and if making a phone call was necessary, keep the conversation short as phone lines were swamped with people searching for answers.

Businesses were flooded and hometown staples were washed away within moments.

As the water slowly trickled out of the Star City, many were left to pick up the pieces as mud and debris scattered across the city. Over 3,000 homes and businesses were damaged by the storm.

Remnants of the tragic flood can still be found within Roanoke, including a photography exhibit by Tommy Firebaugh at the Historical Society of Western Virginia Museum.

While it is possible to see flooding again in our hometowns, the flood of 1985 taught responders and residents alike the importance of weather alerts and preparing a safety plan for when a natural disaster strikes.

"'Disney said it has partnered with Griner to produce several projects based on her yearlong Russia detainment, including a documentary by ESPN Films and a limited series with ABC Signature.

The one-year anniversary since Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison is being marked with the announcement that Disney is helping her tell her story.

The company issued a press release Thursday sharing news of its partnership with the nine-time WNBA All-Star to produce several multimedia projects based on her yearlong detainment in Russia, including a documentary by ESPN Films and a limited scripted series with ABC Signature.

According to Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN, Griner will also have an exclusive sit-down interview with “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts.

“The last two years have been the most harrowing, transformative and illuminating period of my life, and I am grateful to be in a place now to share my story with the world,” said Griner. “I’m proud to partner with ESPN and Disney to share this very personal story because of its incredible potential to inspire hope around the world and their proven ability to do just that.”

Disney shared that the documentary film will chronicle Griner’s life through exclusive video and rare archival information, including the events that led to her playing overseas, her detention and separation from her wife, Cherelle, her quest for freedom, and how she calls for releasing other unjustly jailed inmates.

Burke Magnus, ESPN’s president of content, described Griner as an exceptional athlete with extraordinary resilience in the face of adversity. He said the company was “thrilled to be working with her to tell the nuances of her story and feel confident that this documentary will captivate audiences everywhere.”

Cherelle Griner, who will serve as an executive producer on the projects, noted ESPN, ABC and Disney “were supportive and caring in regards to the human side” of her wife’s situation, both during her detainment and after.

"'There is evidence to support that 2023 may be the worst wildfire season ever recorded. Earlier this year, there were over 1,140 active fires in Canada. And in August, the Hawaiian island of Maui suffered the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century with more than 110 fatalities thus far.

The first line of defense against fire isn’t water — it’s information

When the fire starts, it’ll be a while before anyone knows about it. At first, it’s just a spark from a fallen wire — or maybe the smoldering trunk of a tree, struck by lightning. If the fire is in a remote location, it may not be noticed for hours. Even if it’s noticed early, it’ll take precious minutes to raise the alarm and alert firefighters to the emergency. All the while, the fire, fed by the summer heat and a stiff wind, is growing more intense, devouring everything in its path: land, property, natural habitats, and all-too-often human lives.

It’s literally true that every second counts. There’s no time to waste. Efficiency can be a matter of life and death.

And in this situation, the most efficient first line of defense against fire isn’t water — it’s information. Think about it — you can’t put out a fire if you don’t know where it is or how to get there as quickly as possible.What’s more, timely access to data about past fires provides crucial insight into the conditions that make fires more likely, allowing firefighters and local populations to anticipate and prevent them before they occur.

On the front lines of the climate wars

History tells us that in 64 A.D., Rome burned for six days, and the only action its emperor Nero took as he watched his city incinerate was to play the fiddle.

Luckily, that won’t happen in Brazil.

Brumadinho-based Brigada Carcará is a non-profit on the front lines of the climate wars. Its mission is to control forest fires and to support communities affected by natural and environmental disasters. As increasingly frequent and intense fires blaze through Brazil’s subtropical zones, the Brigada’s role in preserving the lives and livelihoods of local residents, wildlife, farmers, and businesses, has become ever more critical — and ever more challenging.

Adding fuel to the fire

Until recently, Brigada’s challenges were aggravated by a total reliance on manual processes and offline record-keeping. It took many hours, and often several days, to compile data about the causes of fires, their locations, and the nature and extent of the damage done.

None of this information was digitally stored or easily accessible to firefighters and local authorities – and the limited analog information that was available was often incomplete and vulnerable to human error. Lack of transparency and timely, reliable insights into the circumstances of forest fires made it exceedingly difficult to respond effectively to new fires, let alone to avert future outbreaks. And when a fire did break out, firefighters had to depend on old-fashioned printed maps to find their way to the source of the blaze.

With the world around them literally burning, something had to change.

Fighting fire — there’s an app for that

Brigada Carcará turned to SAP to develop a dedicated platform to provide the tools they need to do their jobs with maximum efficiency — saving time, money, and, potentially, lives. A bespoke combination of SAP Integration Suite, based on SAP HANA, SAP Analytics Cloud, and SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) did much more than merely digitize their existing firefighting operation — it provided them with an arsenal of new and powerful tools to predict where fires are likely to break out.

Brigada Carcará’s SAP solution has dramatically increased operational efficiency, supercharging their capacity to predict and respond to fires. The lynchpin is a new mobile application that facilitates detailed and accurate digital documentation of fire-related damage in real-time, including up-to-date digital maps and geo-tagged photo uploads. It also captures precise information about damage to property, land, and habitats. Not only does the new system capture more information — that information is far more reliable, up-to-date, and easily accessible.

Lucas Romário Lara, a founding member of the Brigada Carcará, described the transformative impact of their new solutions: “The platform revolutionized our service structure, generating crucial real-time data for monitoring and analysis. We can now manage everything through our phones, from extinguishing fires, documenting burnt areas, identifying injured animals, and capturing images, to requesting immediate support from other teams. We can share data and best practices not only across the country but even with places like Portugal, which faces similar forest fire challenges.”

Digital fire retardant

Brigada Carcará notable tangible improvements include:

Enhanced fire prevention through improved monitoring and data analysis

Reduced incident recording time from three days to one minute

Structured reforestation plans driven by well-organized data for land and habitat protection

Rehabilitation and replanting of fire-affected forests, involving analysis of charred areas and tree remnants, along with native species cultivation in nurseries

Brigada member Ronnie Gibson sums it up quite nicely: “The SAP application has equipped us for better preparedness. Our reality has completely changed thanks to this technology.”

So it’s no surprise that Brigada Carcará is finalist for the 2023 SAP Innovation Awards. Read more about Brigada Carcará’a remarkable transformation here.'",climate,forest fire
"'HOUSTON — It’s going to take one more Texas-sized matchup to finally settle this Lone Star State showdown.

Nathan Eovaldi remained unbeaten on the mound this postseason, and Mitch Garver and Jonah Heim homered early before a ninth-inning grand slam by Adolis García helped the Texas Rangers avoid elimination with a 9-2 win over the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series on Sunday night.

Road teams are unbeaten in this series going into the decisive Game 7 on Monday night in Houston, when the starting pitchers will be Cristian Javier for the Astros and three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer for the Rangers. Javier was the winning pitcher while Scherzer took the loss last Wednesday in Arlington, an 8-5 Astros victory in Game 3.

“I’m just proud of how these guys keep bouncing back,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “They’re amazing. They really are. They just don’t let adversity get to them.”

Houston and Texas had identical regular-season records (90-72), with the AL West Division title going to the Astros on the head-to-head tiebreaker, 9-4. Now they’re tied once again, and this time the stakes are much higher with a World Series trip on the line.

Eovaldi, who also won Game 2, yielded five hits and two runs in 6 1/3 innings to improve to 4-0 with a 2.42 ERA in the playoffs this year. The wild-card Rangers, one of six MLB teams without a World Series title, are trying to return to the Fall Classic for the first time since back-to-back trips in 2010-11.

“Of course, Nate set the tone out there. How many times has he done that?” Bochy said. “And we just had great at-bats throughout the lineup.”

Houston, trying to repeat as World Series champ, was again felled by a subpar start from Framber Valdez and lackluster play at home. Valdez was charged with five hits and three runs while striking out six batters in five innings to fall to 0-3 with a 9.00 ERA this postseason.

The Rangers led by two before breaking open the game with a five-run ninth, punctuated by the slam from García, who struck out his previous four times up. The slugger was booed throughout the game after being at the center of a bench-clearing scuffle in Game 5, when he was hit by a pitch from Bryan Abreu.

When García knocked a pitch from Ryne Stanek into the Crawford Boxes in left field with one out, many of those fans began streaming for the exits after yet another poor showing at home by Houston.

The Astros, who are 5-0 on the road this postseason, won three in a row in Arlington wearing their orange jerseys to move within a win of reaching their third consecutive World Series. But those orange tops didn’t help them carry their road magic home as they fell to 1-4 at Minute Maid Park this postseason after posting a 39-42 mark there in the regular season.

“That doesn’t matter. It’s in the past,” Houston left fielder Michael Brantley said. “We need to turn the page and be ready for tomorrow.”

No team with a losing record at home has ever reached the World Series.

This ALCS joins the 2019 World Series, which Houston lost to the Washington Nationals in seven games, as the only best-of-seven series in MLB postseason history in which the road team won the first six games.

“Seems a little odd nobody is winning at home,” Garver said. “And I would like for it to stay that way.”

Bochy was at a loss when asked to explain why home has been anything but sweet during this series.

“Wow, I wish I could answer that one,” he said. “That’s the million-dollar question.”

AP photo by Tony Gutierrez / The Texas Rangers' Mitch Garver celebrates as he runs the bases after hitting a home run during the second inning of Game 6 of the AL Championship Series against the host Houston Astros on Sunday night.



Houston led by one after a first-inning RBI single by Yordan Alvarez. Garver tied it on his solo shot to start the second.

Heim connected off Valdez for the second time this series with a two-run shot with two outs in the fourth that put Texas on top 3-1.

“I think seven out of their nine runs scored were on homers. So you’ve really got to keep them in the ballpark,” Astros manager Dusty Baker said.

Houston got within 3-2 on a sacrifice fly by Mauricio Dubón in the sixth, but the Rangers got some insurance thanks to an RBI double by Garver in the eighth off Abreu.

It was the first time the Rangers won an elimination game in the postseason since Game 5 of the 2010 AL Division Series at Tampa Bay, when Cliff Lee pitched a complete game in a 5-1 victory over the Rays. The Rangers had lost five straight such games, and Sunday’s win was just their second in eight tries.

The Astros had a shot to cut into the lead late before García’s big swing, but Texas reliever José Leclerc came through after giving up the decisive three-run homer to Jose Altuve in the ninth inning of Game 5.

Josh Sborz walked Alex Bregman to start the Houston eighth and struck out Alvarez before José Abreu singled with one out.

Leclerc took over and walked Kyle Tucker to load the bases before Dubón lined out softly to shortstop. Pinch-hitter Jon Singleton, who entered with one career postseason at-bat, batted for Jeremy Peña and struck out against Leclerc to end the threat.

Houston went 1-for-8 with runners in scoring position.

“The name of the game is opportunities, and then after that you hope that you come through,” Baker said. “Some days you just don’t get it done.”

Alvarez got Houston’s first hit since the first inning with a one-out single in the sixth. Dubón’s sacrifice fly cut the lead to one.

The Astros looked good early against Eovaldi. Altuve hit a leadoff single and stole second before Brantley walked. There was one out when Alvarez lined a single to make it 1-0. Eovaldi limited the damage when José Abreu lined out before Tucker struck out.

“I felt like I was trying to do a little too much out there,” Eovaldi said of his shaky start. “One run ended up scoring, and it’s like, I’ve got to make sure I leave them there, and at that point of time, try to make sure I execute my pitches.”

Garver sent the first pitch of the second inning into the seats in right field to tie it. The ball was caught barehanded by a man in the second row.

Garver, who had three hits, singled with two outs in the fourth, and Heim followed with his opposite-field shot to right field to make it 3-1. The ball sailed just past the glove of a leaping Tucker and into the first row. Heim, who had a career-high 18 home runs in the regular season, also homered off Valdez in Game 2.

Bryan Abreu pitched the eighth for Houston after appealing the two-game suspension he was given by Major League Baseball for intentionally throwing at García.

The reliever’s hearing is Monday before John McHale Jr., special assistant to commissioner Rob Manfred.

“That could be a huge blow,” Baker said. “You wish you had some final decision about his status. So we took a shot there. Hopefully some of this will be postponed and we’ll have him tomorrow as well.”

Abreu struck out García in the eighth before an RBI double by Garver extended the visitors’ lead to 4-2.

Corey Seager was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the top of the ninth before García’s slam gave him five homers and 15 RBIs in 11 games this postseason. He has gone deep in each of the past three games.'",sports,tennis

"'CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — The Oilbelt Little League needs some help from the community to step up and maintain their fields.

Oilbelt Little League Baseball League Vice President Jake Martini said all the field maintenance, electricity, bleachers upkeep, and more comes directly and fully out of the league's pocket.

""That is where all the donations go to, that is where some of the registration fees and all that stuff goes so we can up keep this park,"" Martini said.

Back in May, Nueces County set aside $3.1 million from the American Rescue Plan Act to be put towards the facility. But the county does not have a set date as to when the funds will be put to use, only that they must be used by December of 2026.

Martini said although they are grateful the county has given them these funds, the facility is in desperate needs for repairs now.

""Most of our bleachers and our dugouts and out batting cages are 20, 30, 40 years old, we keep putting Band-Aids on them to get through the seasons,"" Martini said.

Ricky Rogers, the president of The Oilbelt Little League said it’s not only donations they are in need for but also some extra hands on deck.

""We paint the fields, the dugouts, we paint the stands, we paint the concession stands and so right now what we are looking for is help,"" Rogers said.

Martini said every spring season, nearly 700 kids sign up for the league. He said that is why it’s so important to keep the facility safe and cared for, and so the kids can also create great memories.

""We try to give them the best experience that we can and I feel that the nicer the field is they play on the happier they are, the happier the parents are and the more fun everybody is going to have,"" Martini said.

Rogers said any donation or extra hands can truly make a difference.

""It’s the little things that we can change to make this place better,"" Rogers said.

"'An archaeologist measures rock paintings at the Ponta das Lajes archaeological site, in the rural area of Manaus, Brazil, on Oct. 28. The archaeological site was exposed following a drought in the Negro River.

The Negro River, the major tributary that runs through the Brazilian Amazon, has reached historic lows, revealing millennia-old carvings previously hidden under water.

The engravings deeply etched into the black rock along the riverbanks represent human faces, animals and other figures, and are thought to be 1,000 to 2,000 years old, archaeologists said.

“They allow us to understand the way of life of prehistoric populations,” Jaime de Santana Oliveira, an archaeologist with Brazil’s National Historic and Artistic Heritage Institute, said.

The scientists think other rocks at the site were used to sharpen arrows and stone tools.

The Ponto das Lajes archaeological site is located in the rural area of Manaus, the largest city and capital of Amazonas state. From there, locals and tourists can observe the “Meeting of Waters,” which occurs when the dark, Coca-Cola-colored Negro River and the pale, clay-colored Solimoes River converge without merging and run parallel to each other over several miles.

The petroglyphs first were spotted in 2010, when another bad drought struck the region, but had not been observable since then before the current drought.

Low river levels in Amazonas have turned once navigable rivers into endless sand banks and mud, leaving hundreds of communities isolated. Public authorities have scrambled to get food and water to those communities in recent weeks.

Earlier this week, The Associated Press observed the delivery of basic goods. Boats had to dock miles away, forcing residents, most of them small farmers and fishermen, to walk long distances.

Manaus and other nearby cities are experiencing high temperatures and heavy smoke from fires set for deforestation and pasture clearance. The drought is also the likely cause of dozens of river dolphin deaths in Tefe Lake, near the Amazon River.

Dry spells are part of the Amazon’s cyclical weather pattern, usually from May to October. This season’s drought has been fiercer than usual due to two climate phenomena: the warming of northern tropical Atlantic Ocean waters and El Niño — the warming of surface waters in the Equatorial Pacific region.'",climate,drought
"'Towards the end of August each year, the Quinault tribe digs for razor clams on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. The commercial-clamming day—known as the school-clothes dig—is a family event that helps Quinault members raise extra cash for supplies before the start of the school year. In 2015-16 however, those clams contained a toxin that could lead to brain damage or even death.

That event was triggered by a record-breaking marine heatwave off the coast of the United States and parts of Canada, with corals bleached and toxic phytoplanktons driven to shore. In 2023, records are again being broken.

Dr Vera Trainer is a specialist in phytoplankton blooms of the sort that caused havoc across the Pacific seaboard in 2015—and, because of the way toxins are retained in shellfish or crab for example—into the following year too.

“We saw the toxin domoic acid, which is produced by the algae, become concentrated in the flesh of filter feeders,” explains Dr Trainer, a research lead at the University of Washington’s Olympic Natural Resources Centre. Those filter feeders include many species that people eat, such as sardines, anchovies—a food of whales too—shellfish and crab. One of the most lucrative fisheries on the eastern Pacific was shut down at short notice and for many months.

A cascading effect

Dr Trainer describes the effects of such heatwaves as a “cascade”, affecting biodiversity, the economy and coastal communities alike.

Defined in 2015 as a period of at least five consecutive days when water temperatures exceed the 90th percentile of a baseline threshold, the impact of marine heatwaves is widespread and potentially long-lasting: as well as the prospect of toxic algal blooms, there is increased mortality of economically important species, aquaculture is affected, and there is biodiversity loss and the knock-on effects that come with that. Warm water increases the likelihood of extreme weather, as well as adding to ocean stressors through stratification, acidification and deoxygenation.

They are also on the rise: according to the Marine Heatwave International Working Group, there has been a 50% increase in these events over the past ten years, while marine heatwaves are now ten times stronger than in pre-industrial times.

Even with that in mind, the scope and intensity of the 2023 heatwaves have taken the scientific community by surprise, says Professor Michael Burrows, a marine ecologist at the Scottish Association for Marine Science and a member of the working group. He says the word “unprecedented” is overused, but that is exactly how he describes the situation the world finds itself in today. “The increase [in marine heatwaves] over the last two years has been massive relative to previous annual increases,” he says. “It just has gone off the scale in terms of what we might expect.”

Because marine heatwaves are about warmer oceans rather than about warm water, they can occur anywhere in the world. As scientists in Florida were preparing to move coral from the ocean and into labs this summer, in a bid to save them from temperatures above the bleaching threshold of 30.63 degrees, the United Kingdom and Ireland were experiencing their own record marine heatwave. “The water off the west coast of Ireland should have been around 13 degrees: it was over 17 degrees. That is a drastic difference,” says Dr Peter Miller, a marine-earth observation scientist at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and part of a team that has developed satellite algorithms to warn salmon farmers about harmful algal blooms.

A new El Niño cycle

While climate change and overall warmer oceans are driving an uptick in marine heatwaves, these events remain hard to predict. As Dr Miller points out, ocean models are increasingly sophisticated but what they can’t do is pinpoint when an event like the June heatwave will happen. “That depended on so many factors happening at one time,” he explains. “It might have been to do with atmospheric currents of warm air together with the timing of El Niño, together with maybe a deep current in the ocean that brought warmer water within range—all kinds of things conspiring together.”

Professor Burrows also talks about El Niño as a factor. “Ocean circulation events like El Niño do produce conditions where more extreme heatwaves are more likely,” he says. As we enter a new El Niño cycle, marine heatwaves are expected to increase further. “There are other systems—oceanographic phenomena—that make certain places and certain periods more prone to heatwaves,” he continues. “There are ocean-current changes and a connection to weather systems too.”

As well as challenges around prediction, it is also difficult to say what the impact is, so far, of the 2023 heatwaves. “It is difficult to project what the effects of these events are going to be because they are unprecedented,” says Dr Miller

“Our predictions are based on what’s happened in the past but we’ve never seen these conditions before. We’re in brand new territory, so we can only make our best guesses.”

Multiple stressors

Professor Tim Smyth—a colleague of Dr Miller—is head of science for marine biogeochemistry and observations at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, with a brief that includes leading the Western Channel Observatory, which gathers data on “pretty much everything that there is for looking at ocean ecosystem health”. The observatory boasts both breadth and longevity: it has been gathering ocean data since 1903, making it one of the longest time series available and offering a 120-year view on marine temperatures.

Looking at data from a station about 20 nautical miles offshore in the English Channel from 1903 through to the present day, Professor Smyth explains that when you look for temperature anomalies, “it's quite clear that over the last 20 years, we've not had very many cold anomalies [where temperatures drop below the 10th percentile for at least five consecutive days]. What we have had is a lot of these 90th percentile-plus anomalies.” Since around the 1980s, there has been this “gradual warning” trend, he continues. “Looking at 2023 and that June-July heatwave, it was really quite a long way above the 90th percentile— actually at the maximum that we'd ever measured.”

It is not yet clear whether marine-heatwave trends will return to the more gradual increases seen previously or if the 2023 record-breakers are an acceleration—and an indication—of what the scientific community should come to expect.

Professor Smyth points out that you cannot separate marine heatwaves from other ocean stressors. “We're not just talking about temperature, we're talking about stressing the ocean in terms of nutrient loading, in terms of increasing nitrates and phosphates in the water, in terms of ocean chemistry. We’re stressing it in terms of oxygen levels,” he warns.

“If you continuously, and multilaterally, stress a system, when does that become an intolerable stress that it cannot recover from?”

"'""Drop, cover, and hold on!""

In California, millions of people were told to pause classes, office work and whatever else they happen to be doing at about 10:19 a.m. PT on Thursday to follow those instructions. The exercise — which lasts for one minute — is an earthquake safety drill called the Great ShakeOut that is observed annually on the third Thursday in October and practiced widely throughout the state.

The Great ShakeOut has been held each year in California since its launch in 2008, after a group of experts modeled the potentially catastrophic damages that could occur if a major earthquake were to hit the region and authored a report, ""The ShakeOut Scenario,"" that underscored the importance of educating the public about how to protect themselves when a quake actually happens. Now backed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Great ShakeOut quickly expanded past California.

Drills were being conducted on Thursday across the United States and overseas, with more than 17.5 million people expected to participate in the drill nationwide, according to the Southern California Earthquake Center. Globally, the numbers are much higher: At least 56 million people are registered to participate internationally. In the U.S., anyone conducting and participating in the drill is encouraged to do it at 10:19 a.m. in their local time zone, although the ShakeOut website notes that ""you can register your ShakeOut drill for any day of the year, and drill at a time of your choice.""

Although experts agree ""Drop, Cover, and Hold On"" makes sense as an earthquake safety motto for most situations where people are indoors, the Great ShakeOut also aims to educate people about what to do if an earthquake strikes while they are outside or in their cars.

Why does the Great ShakeOut matter?

Emergency management officials say participating in the drill, and raising awareness about earthquake hazards and safety practices, is important even for people living in places that are technically at a low risk of experiencing an earthquake, because one could happen anywhere at any time.

""Over the last few years, there have been major earthquakes in many parts of the world,"" FEMA wrote in a news statement about the drill. ""Whether you're at home, work, school or traveling in an earthquake-prone area, you should know how to protect yourself during an earthquake.""

The Great ShakeOut drill holds particular weight in California, since the state is situated on top of a major fault line and is consequently prone to earthquakes, which in the past have been catastrophic and deadly at times. The sprawling San Andreas fault — essentially a rupture in Earth's surface between two tectonic plates — runs parallel to the Pacific Coast across most of California and weaves through densely populated sections like the Bay Area and Los Angeles.

""Most people in the Bay Area live less than 10 miles from a fault that can have a damaging earthquake,"" reads one message on the Great ShakeOut website. Further south, the fault line is just about 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles.

Movement along the fault — and a number of smaller faults within the San Andreas Fault System — is primarily what drives California earthquakes. The potential for sudden instability along the faults is an ongoing source of concern for people in the state wondering if and when the next major earthquake will strike, and how bad it will be.

California's earthquake history

Luther Strayer, a structural geologist and professor at California State University, East Bay, recently talked to CBS Bay Area about when California's next big earthquake might hit. Strayer has been studying the Hayward fault, another California fault that has caused disastrous earthquakes, for about a decade.

""There will be an earthquake probably in a lot of our lifetimes. I would guess in the next 30 years, everybody who is living in the Bay Area will experience a pretty large earthquake,"" Strayer said, adding, ""The recurrence interval on the Hayward fault is somewhere between 140-170 years, and we're in that range from 1868.""

""Predicting earthquakes is as of yet impossible. What we can do is tell you whether or not a fault is likely to go,"" he said.

The likelihood of a 7.0 major earthquake causing serious damage in the next 30 years is 51% for the San Francisco Bay area and 46% for the Los Angeles area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The Great ShakeOut drill comes amid a week of earthquake activity in California.

Tuesday marked 34 years since the Loma Prieta earthquake, which hit Northern California on Oct. 17, 1989, and is remembered as one of the state's worst and most notorious quakes of the last century. (The other, and perhaps the most infamous, was the San Francisco earthquake, an estimated 7.9 magnitude quake that struck on April 18, 1906, causing fires to break out that lasted for days and leaving thousands dead in its wake.)

Then, on Wednesday, a magnitude 4.1 quake struck less than 50 miles outside of San Francisco's city center, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. No injuries or significant infrastructure damages were reported in connection with it.

MyShake alert test

An emergency alert test message, notifying cell phone users across California, Oregon and Washington about a major earthquake, was also scheduled to go out Thursday in time with the Great ShakeOut drill at 10:19 a.m. PT. The test alert would come via the MyShake mobile application, developed at the University of California at Berkeley's seismology laboratory in coordination with the U.S. Geological Survey.

Some California residents reported that they received the test earlier than expected Thursday morning.

The U.S. Geological Survey acknowledged the error in a social media post and said it was working to determine what happened. CBS News contacted the Berkeley Seismology Lab but did not receive an immediate response.

"'The Tampa Bay area’s rainy season was one of the driest in more than a decade. With dry season starting earlier this month and running until late May, officials are asking residents to conserve water.

According to the Southwest Florida Water Management District, 2007 was the last rainy season that was this dry.

""We had a very dry spring,"" Tamera McBride, a hydrologic data manager with the Southwest Florida Water Management District, said. ""The wet season, as I mentioned, has been dry, and at this point, we like to look at our 12-month rainfall totals. The 12-month rainfall total is 9.9 inches below the mean below average rainfall for this time of year.""

""We've seen some dry times over the past decades, but this is definitely one of the driest it's been in a long time,"" Brandon Moore, the public communications manager for Tampa Bay Water, said.

McBride said Hurricane Idalia helped rainfall totals, but not enough.

""It is difficult to overcome the amount of rain when we're in the summertime storm periods, and we receive regular afternoon thunderstorms,"" McBride said. ""Over time incrementally, that builds up and helps us with our 12-month total, but we didn't receive as much of that as normal. So, one big storm, it's hard to make up the deficit with just one big storm.""

According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, parts of the area are experiencing severe and extreme drought conditions. Tampa Bay Water said it’s like an entire month of rainfall didn’t happen. Moore said the region is in a stage one water shortage, which means water conservation is even more important.

""Water restrictions for our region are year-round, and there are times like now that it's really dry. And when it gets dry like this, it really shows that it's time to save some water,"" Moore said. ""Use only what you need. You can do things like fix leaks in your home, turn off the water while you're brushing your teeth, but the biggest savings come from outdoor watering.""

Moore said outdoor watering can use up to 50% of the water used at home. He said it’s important to only water on the days you’re allowed by your municipality and if it rains, skip a week of watering afterwards.

Dunedin officials said reclaimed water pressure isn’t available right now because of the dry conditions and high demand. It has been on and off since May, officials said, which is normal during drought conditions. You can call the Dunedin Water Division to see if reclaimed water is available near you.

Clearwater and St. Pete said their reclaimed water systems are operating normally for the dry season, which means periodically reducing the reclaimed water pressure due to the demand.

"'Fall in Northern California means Apple Hill. It was a bumper crop this year, but climate change could threaten apples from blossom to bushel.

Example video title will go here for this video

CAMINO, Calif. — If you're making the trip up to Apple Hill this fall, the scene looks completely different from last fall.

""Everywhere in Apple Hill... they're going to have nice apples this year,"" said Tom Heflin when asked about the fall season.

He and his wife Crista have owned Rainbow Orchards since 1977, but Tom was raised in the area so he likes to say he's been here longer than Apple Hill.

Heflin grows a variety of apples. Most people come to Rainbow Orchards looking for the Honeycrisp variety. Some come for the Granny Smith to make apple pie, and Cameos and Fujis are also popular.

No matter the variety of apple you're looking for, the growing season and harvest has been one to remember.

""I can't think of a better summer growing season in all the years we've been here,"" said Heflin. ""It's absolutely perfect from bloom to harvest.""

This perfect season started over the winter with the abundant mid-elevation snow the region saw.

""We had a lot of snow, which is good,"" Heflin said. ""Because of the late snow, they [the apples] didn't bloom early, which is also very good. Last year, it was a warm winter, they bloomed and it froze. This year, bloom, no freeze, perfect weather.""

Every weekend at Rainbow Orchards between Labor Day and Halloween gets busier and busier as the weather cools down. More and more people are thinking about fall, and they'll make the trek up to Apple Hill.

Climate change threatens what is a pilgrimage of sorts for many Northern Californians. Warmer nights and warmer days, along with more wet to dry and heat to freeze whiplash, could jeopardize everything from the apple’s color and taste to the apple’s ability to grow at all.

For instance, an early heatwave in the 2022 spring season led many of the apple trees to bud and blossom early. Then, a late-season cold snap damaged those same buds and blossoms to the point where the apple harvest last year was more than dismal.

""If the nights are too warm, we won't get the chill hours, the blossoms won't form properly while the tree is dormant,"" explained Heflin. ""If it warms up too quick after the winter, the trees come out too soon, the bloom is too soon and then you've got the frost problem.""

Apple trees need 800 hours – or a bit more than 30 days – of chill during the winter. Chill is when temperatures are between 34 to 50 degrees.

Over the last 50 years, the average winter low temperature in Placerville has warmed from about 30 degrees to 35 degrees. While that's not putting the apples into the danger zone just yet, it is a significant baseline shift. We know climate change is making nighttime low temperatures warm at a faster rate than daytime high temperatures. Furthermore, on average in the United States, wintertime temperatures are warming twice as fast as summertime temperatures.

""I can't say that the weather has affected us that much,"" said Heflin. ""In the long term, weather will affect us.""

Warmer temperatures and an earlier start to growing season also means more opportunities for bugs and diseases to take hold, which can cut into profits because of the need for an additional round of pesticide and herbicide to protect the apples.

It can also mean more water is needed to keep the trees healthy. More water can also cut into profits due to higher water bills. Heflin says that's something he and El Dorado County monitor very closely.

""The El Dorado County Irrigation District has a program where there are probes in the orchard, and they read the probes and we only irrigate when we need to,"" Heflin explained. ""We're very tight with our water up here because we really realize how important water is.""

And yet, as much as some things around the orchard change, others stay the same.

The first parking spot at Rainbow Orchards is marked by a sign declaring the spot reserved for ""The Donut Queen"" — Crista. She is in charge of the making the apple cider donuts at Rainbow Orchards, which Tom credits as putting them on the map.

""I'll have to admit, I made myself a donut this morning and it was really good,"" said Heflin.

Climate change presents challenges to all aspects of life as we know it, and the apples and the way of life on Apple Hill are no exception but that doesn't discourage Farmer Tom and his wife. They’ll still be up here growing apples, making cider and frying donuts, all while adapting to a new, more variable climate.

""But start with the donuts,"" Tom said, offering some parting wisdom. ""That's a good way to start the day.""

GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin archaeologists are crediting a man and daughter with discovering the remains of what could be a ship that ran aground during the deadly Peshtigo Fire more than 150 years ago.

Tim Wollak and his 6-year-old daughter, Henley, of Peshtigo, were fishing on Lake Michigan in the bay of Green Bay near Green Island this summer when their sonar picked up something Henley thought was an octopus, WLUK-TV reported Wednesday.

Wollak posted photos of the sonar images on Facebook, which eventually drew the attention of the Wisconsin Historical Society. The society posted a note Dec. 11 on Facebook saying an underwater remote vehicle surveyed the site Dec. 4 and confirmed the object is the wreck of a three-masted sailing ship submerged in 8 to 10 feet of water.

Archaeologists believe the ship may be the 122-foot-long George L. Newman. The ship was hauling lumber from Little Suamico on the evening of Oct. 8, 1871, when it became enveloped in thick smoke from the Peshtigo Fire and ran aground on the southeast point of Green Island.

The keeper of the island's lighthouse rescued the crew, according to the historical society's tweet, but the ship was abandoned and was eventually covered with sand and forgotten.

The historical society plans to survey the wreck again in the spring of 2024 and may push to list the site on the National Register of Historic Places.

“I don't know how we top it,” Wollak told WLUK. “I told her (Henley) I'm pretty sure there's no one else in her school that has ever found a shipwreck that nobody had recorded before ... I guess we'll just have to fish more and see if we can find more shipwrecks.”

"'Philadelphia Eagles’ quarterback Jalen Hurts’ fumbling issues surfaced again during their 33-13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys last week. Hurts fumbled away a possession against the Cowboys and his fumbles have become a major problem for the Eagles.

Hurts has fumbled in seven straight games, the longest streak by any NFL player since Carson Wentz fumbled in nine straight games over the 2019 and 2020 seasons. Hurts has fumbled the football eight times in 2023, tied for sixth in the NFL. Hurts’ fumbles have occurred in 13 games this season after he fumbled a total of eight times during the entire 2022 regular season.

Eagles’ coach Nick Sirianni has placed an emphasis on protecting the football as the Eagles prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks in their Week 15 game on Monday night. Sirianni wants Hurts to do more to protect the football when he’s getting hit in passing situations or carrying the football.

“We have to do a better job protecting the football going to the ground,” Sirianni told reporters Tuesday. “Jalen has to do a better job with that, going to the ground, and we got to do a better job coaching that.”

Hurts worked on intentionally falling to the ground with the football in his hands during practice this week.

Earlier this week, Nick Sirianni said Jalen Hurts had to do a better job of protecting the football as he falls to the ground, an ""unnatural"" motion. But Sirianni said that starts with coaching.



Today at practice, they repped it: pic.twitter.com/7WdDse8srf — Dave Zangaro (@DZangaroNBCS) December 14, 2023

Since he became the full-time starter in 2021, Hurts has fumbled 26 times, tied for 4th-most in the NFL behind Chicago Bears’ quarterback Justin Fields (35), Jacksonville Jaguars’ quarterback Trevor Lawrence (29) and Miami Dolphins’ quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (27).

“Protect the ball is kind of always a thing we push out every time we talk about a key to victory, ball security is a big thing, so you know that that’s a focus point,” Hurts told reporters Thursday.

Hurts isn’t the only player having trouble maintaining possession of the football. Wide receivers’ A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith each fumbled away a possession against the Cowboys. The Eagles lost three fumbles against the Cowboys.

Numerous roads and highways in the Wayne area remain closed to traffic Wednesday morning, according to township officials. A full list of road closures in the Wayne area can be found here.

ABC7 News in New York reported several drivers who were stranded on flooded roads in the Paterson area were rescued this morning by emergency workers, and some local schools remain closed because of flooding. Just like Wayne, Paterson is under a state of emergency because of widespread flooding.

Willowbrook Mall is open, and most of its parking lots are dry Wednesday morning, but an access road off Route 23 is closed. A car wash on the banks of the Passaic River near the Willowbrook Mall remains underwater Wednesday morning, along with a nearby parking lot off Route 23.

Record-breaking flooding

On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings for areas along the Passaic River in parts of Essex, Morris and Passaic counties, and those warnings remain active Wednesday.

The weather service said water in the Passaic River near the Singac section of Little Falls has risen as high as 12.4 feet high — breaking the previous record of 11.5 feet. Among the impacts that can be expected at various flooding levels are these, according to the weather service:

At 8.5 feet, portions of the Wayne Town Center parking lot begin to flood. Hobson Avenue and Riverlawn Drive in Wayne begin to flood. Fairfield Road, Fayette Avenue, and Riversedge Road in Wayne can flood as water backs up the Pompton River. Lincoln Boulevard in Lincoln Park can also flood due to backwater up the Pompton River. The Pequannock River Park also floods.

At 9 feet, Two Bridges Road in Fairfield is subject to closures. At 9.5 feet, Camp Lane and Marginal Road in Fairfield begins to flood.

At 10 feet, Two Bridges Road in Fairfield begins to flood. Finns Drive, Siesta Drive, and Market street in Wayne are all susceptible to flooding. William Street, Louis Street and Zeliff Avenue in Little Falls can begin to flood. Portions of Lincoln Park become impassable. The Meadows Golf Club in Lincoln Park floods.

At 11 feet, Little Falls Road in Fairfield floods. Flooding increases across the Singac section of Little Falls.

At 12 feet, Willowbrook Boulevard begins to flood. The Route 46 ramp to access the Willowbrook Mall can flood as the Naachtpunkt Brook backs up.

At 13 feet, flooding increases and spreads across Lincoln Park between the Meadows Golf Club and the Pompton River. Flooding spreads across Fairfield in the vicinity of Big Piece Road. Horseneck Road in Fairfield becomes impassable.

Forecasters are expecting the Passaic River to fall to 9.6 feet by Friday evening, which is still above the flood stage of 8.5 feet. The previous record crest of 11.5 feet occurred on Sept. 3, 2021, after the remnants of Hurricane Ida saturated New Jersey with torrential rain and flooding.

‘Hoping for the best’

Many local residents have spent the past few days away from their homes, having heeded advisories from emergency management officials to evacuate. Streets and parking lots in the low-lying areas of Wayne and Little Falls all remain flooded Wednesday, and now the waiting game has begun.

Donald Gallareilli has spent the past two nights at a hotel with his wife and Scottish Terrier, Jasmine. He returned to Little Falls Wednesday morning hoping to get a look at his house on Riverview Circle, but couldn’t get past the 3 feet of flood water on West End Avenue.

”A few of my neighbors stayed,” Galllareilli said. “Our house is a little bit elevated, so we’re hoping for the best.”

Floodwaters have receded in Pompton Lakes in the area off Dawes Highway, leaving streets caked in mud. Some area residents say the worst appears to be over, so now the waiting game has begun for evacuees.

Danny Mustafosti evacuated his home on Monday and has spent the past two nights at his brother’s home in West Milford. He tried to get a look at his home on Wednesday morning, but he was stopped by heavy flooding — about 3 feet of water — on Ryerson Avenue.

Mustafosti said the flooding this time is worse than it was in September 2021, when Hurricane Ida’s remnants came through.

The huge storm in 2021 left a big path of destruction in its wake, turning many New Jersey roadways into rivers, toppling scores of trees and power lines and damaging numerous homes. On top of that, several tornadoes touched down in the Garden State during that storm, with one ripping through a South Jersey town and destroying at least 20 houses.

Heavy flooding in Fairfield

Police in Fairfield are urging residents and business owners to be cautious when driving, because of the high water levels that persist in some parts of the area.

“Due to flooded roadways, travel still remains challenging around the township,” the police department posted on its Facebook page Wednesday morning. “Due to flooding on the roadway of Route 46 East in Wayne near the Willowbrook Mall, Route 46 East in Fairfield is closed near the West Essex Diner. Anyone needing to go east is encouraged to use Route 80 or to find an alternate route.”

Fairfield police also said other major roads remained closed as of this morning, including Bloomfield Avenue, Little Falls Road at Pier Lane, Horseneck Road between Hollywood Avenue and the Montville town line, and Two Bridges Road into Lincoln Park.

“To see a list of all affected roadways, citizens can go to the Township of Fairfield’s website at www.Fairfieldnj.org,” the police department noted. “You can also call the township’s flood hotline at (201) 522-9267. This phone will remain available throughout this emergency.”

Red Cross helping evacuated residents

The New Jersey chapter of the American Red Cross has volunteers working in flood-affected areas of North Jersey on Wednesday and has set up a temporary shelter at the Little Falls Civic Center in Little Falls.

Sheri Ferreira, communications director for the Red Cross’s New Jersey region, said the Little Falls shelter, which opened yesterday, will remain open as long as there is a need. It is open to anyone in Passaic County who has been displaced by flooding.

”You can come and have a meal, charge a device, or just come in to stay warm,” Ferreira told NJ Advance Media. “If they want, they can spend the night.”

Ferreira said six people visited the shelter Tuesday night, and one stayed overnight.

Evacuees can also pick up water, snacks and cleanup kits at the Lincoln Park Public Library at 12 US-202 in Lincoln Park or at the Lodi Fire Department, at 99 Kennedy Drive in Lodi.

The Red Cross is in flood-affected communities today:

PHILADELPHIA — Bryce Harper smashed the first pitch he saw on his 31st birthday into the seats, Kyle Schwarber hit his first homer of the postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Philadelphia Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series on Monday night.

Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate. Harper, who also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs, hit his 10th homer in two postseasons with the Phillies.

“I’ve always wanted to play on my birthday,” he said before the game.

Zack Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending National League champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.

José Alvarado got four big outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the postseason after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.

The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving, deliriously-cheering fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave fans a reason to stop — or a chance for Arizona to catch its breath until it was too late.

Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen’s first pitch 420 feet into the right-field seats. There was some minor consternation that Schwarber — with 47 homers this season and 93 over the last two — had yet to go deep through six playoff games. How easy it was to forget that Schwarber didn’t hit any in the Wild Card Series or NLDS last season before he launched six in the NLCS and World Series. So those Schwarbombs might just be getting started.

“We know what type of guy Schwarber’s going to be for us. He’s huge in that 1 spot,” Harper said. “There’s never a doubt on how good he’s going to be. We’re excited to see what he can do in the NLCS and as we go.”

Four pitches later, Harper homered — the first time in 127 postseason games Philadelphia went deep twice in the first inning.

When Castellanos lined his fifth homer of the playoffs in the third — all in the past three games — it gave the Phillies 32 home runs in 13 postseason games at Citizens Bank Park over the last two years.

The Kelce Bros approved. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — minus celebrity friend Taylor Swift — and Eagles center Jason Kelce went wild. Travis pointed to his brother as Jason pounded a beer in their suite.

Gallen, a South Jersey native, had his name derisively drawn out to “Galll-ennnn” by Phillies fans each time the 17-game winner got into a jam. Too many times, for Arizona.

Trea Turner hit a one-double in the third, leaving first base open. Gallen pitched to Harper instead of walking him and got burned by an RBI single for a 4-0 lead.

J.T. Realmuto added an RBI single in the fifth.

“Gallen, he’s been throwing the ball well all year. Just tried to get on top of him as much as we could, score early,” Harper said. “Schwarber starting the game off right there was huge for us.”

Those runs proved crucial for the Phillies. Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run homer off Wheeler in the sixth that made it 5-2.

Seranthony Domínguez opened the door in the seventh for the Diamondbacks when his throwing error on a comebacker led to an unearned run. Alvarado retired pinch-hitter Emmanuel Rivera on a groundout to keep it 5-3 and tossed a scoreless eighth.

SNAKE EYES

The Diamondbacks, who at 84-78 squeezed into the playoffs as the final NL wild card, were held to four hits.

GOING DEEP

Schwarber’s fourth leadoff homer in the postseason moved him past Jimmy Rollins and Derek Jeter for most in baseball history.

Harper joined St. Louis’ Kolten Wong, Tampa Bay’s Evan Longoria and Kansas City’s Willie Aikens as the only players in postseason history to homer on his birthday.

Castellanos’ five homers in his last three postseason game — he hit two in consecutive games against Atlanta — made him the second player to hit those marks. New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson did it in the 1977 World Series.

UP NEXT

Arizona sends RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0 postseason, 0.00 ERA) to the mound for Game 2.

RHP Aaron Nola (2-0 postseason, 1.42 ERA) pitches for the Phillies. Nola is eligible for free agency after the World Series after he tabled contract extension talks with the team in spring training. Nola made $16 million this year on the club option that was part of the $45 million, four-year deal he signed ahead of the 2019 season. Nola said he wanted to stay in Philadelphia.

“I hope so. I really do,” Nola said before the game. “I love it here. Obviously, it’s the only place I’ve been. I came up through some special times in the rebuilding era ask and getting to witness and be a part of a lot of different type of teams.”

All the latest developments from the Israel Hamas war.

Defiant Netanyahu has no plans to resign

ADVERTISEMENT

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has no plans to resign, despite a public uproar over the deadly Oct. 7 Hamas raid that killed over 1,400 Israelis and sparked the current Israel-Hamas war.

Netanyahu was asked at a news conference on Monday if he has considered stepping down.

“The only thing that I intend to have resigned is Hamas. We’re going to resign them to the dustbin of history,” he said. “That’s my goal. That’s my responsibility.”

Netanyahu also said he would not agree to a cease-fire, saying it would be tantamount “to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.”

""Israel did not start this war. Israel did not want this war. But Israel will win this war,"" he said.

Israel expands ground assault into Gaza

Israeli troops and tanks pushed deeper into Gaza on Monday, advancing on two sides of the territory’s main city.

Video circulating on social media shows an Israeli tank and bulldozer in central Gaza blocking the enclave's main north-south highway, which the Israeli military earlier told Palestinians to use to escape the ground offensive.

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who remain in the north would no longer be able to escape if the road is blocked since it’s the only useable route south.

In footage captured by a local journalist, a car is seen approaching an earth barrier across the road. The car stops and turns around. As it heads away, an Israeli tank appears to open fire, and an explosion engulfs the car.

The journalist, in another car, races away in terror, screaming, “Go back! Go back!” at an approaching ambulance and other vehicles. The Gaza Health Ministry later said three people were killed in the car that was hit.

Israel has positioned its forces on both sides of Gaza City and the surrounding areas of northern Gaza, in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a “second stage” of the war that began after Hamas’ 7 Oct attack.

Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply if Israeli forces expand their ground operation and end up battling Palestinian militants in dense residential areas.

Though Israel ordered Palestinians to flee the north, where Gaza City is located, and move south, hundreds of thousands remain, in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones.

Around 117,000 displaced people hoping to stay safe from strikes are staying in hospitals in northern Gaza, alongside thousands of patients and staff, according to UN figures.

Moscow blames Kyiv for antisemitic airport riot

Russia has accused Ukraine of playing a ""key role"" in an anti-Israeli riot which broke out at an airport in the Russian republic of Dagestan.

On Sunday, a large crowd of men in the Muslim Caucasian region stormed Makhachkala airport, chanting antisemitic slogans and looking for Israelis.

Moscow did not provide any evidence for its claim, as fighting between Israel and Hamas inflames tensions around the world.

The clashes were “the result of a planned and externally led provocation” in which Kyiv played a “key and direct” role, said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova in a statement.

ADVERTISEMENT

Ukraine wanted to ""undermine"" relations between Russia's different religious communities, she added.

Kyiv has not reacted to Moscow's allegation, though President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - who is Jewish - said the event demonstrated Russia's ""culture of hatred against other nations"".

Sixty people have been arrested over the incident, Russian authorities said on Monday.

Dagestan’s Ministry of Health said more than 20 were injured, with two in critical condition. This included police officers and civilians.

Video on social media showed some in the crowd waving Palestinian flags and others trying to overturn a police car. Antisemitic slogans were shouted and some examined the passports of arriving passengers, apparently in an attempt to identify those who were Israeli.

In a statement Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel “expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis.”

While voicing support for Palestinians in Gaza, the regional Dagestani government appealed to citizens to remain calm and not take part in such protests.

“We urge residents of the republic to treat the current situation in the world with understanding. Federal authorities and international organizations are making every effort to bring about a ceasefire against Gaza civilians … we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to the provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society,” it wrote on Telegram.

Gaza water shortage forces Palestinians to rely on sea

The besieged Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million people don’t have access to clean, running water after Israel cut off essential supplies to the enclave.

If water does trickle from the tap, residents say it's so contaminated with sewage and seawater that it’s undrinkable. Under these circumstances, some are forced to use the sea to bathe, wash clothes and clean their cookware.

ADVERTISEMENT

On Sunday, 33 trucks carrying water, food and medicine entered Gaza's only border crossing from Egypt.

Israel said it has opened two water lines in southern Gaza within the past week, though it is not clear if they are functioning.

Since 9 October, Israel has imposed a ""total siege"" on Gaza, cutting off supplies of water, electricity and food. With the territory already subject to an Israeli blockade, this is inflicting a dire humanitarian toll on civilians.

Journalists 'explicitly targetted' in strike near Israeli border - report

Video analysis and witness testimonies from the scene of strikes that killed one journalist and injured six others in south Lebanon this month has found they were “explicitly targeted,” Reporters Without Borders said in a statement Sunday.

Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed near the village of Alma al-Shaab while covering skirmishes between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group.

ADVERTISEMENT

“Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time ... from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting,” the statement said.

Analysis noted the journalists had been filming on a hillside for more than an hour until the strikes hit about 37 to 38 seconds apart, both coming from the direction of Israel.

The first killed Abdallah; the second hit a vehicle belonging to an Al Jazeera team, injuring journalists standing next to it, the statement said. It noted that the journalists were wearing helmets and vests marked “press,” and the car was marked “press” on the roof.

It added that witnesses reported seeing an Israeli helicopter fly over the scene shortly before the strikes. The report did not specifically say Israel was responsible for the fire, saying the investigation was ongoing.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond Sunday to a request for comment on the analysis.

Military spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht previously said Israel was “looking into” the episode. He did not confirm whether the journalists had been hit by Israeli shelling.

More than 3,000 children killed in Gaza

The number of children killed in the blockaded Gaza Strip since the start of the Hamas-Israel war earlier this month has exceeded the number killed in armed conflict every year globally since 2019, international charity Save the Children said on Sunday.

In a statement, the charity cited numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry of at least 3,195 children killed in the war that was sparked following a surprise Hamas attack on 7 Oct.

It also mentioned the deaths of 33 children in the occupied West Bank and 29 children killed in Israel.

“The numbers are harrowing and with violence not only continuing but expanding in Gaza right now, many more children remain at grave risk,” Save the Children Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territory Jason Lee said in a statement.

“A cease-fire is the only way to ensure their safety.”

After the unprecedented bloody attack by Hamas on October 7 on Israeli soil, Israel said it wanted to destroy the Palestinian Islamist movement and has since carried out incessant bombings on the Gaza Strip, which it controls.

"'The local state of emergency in Madison County has been lifted now that the Quaker Run Fire has been fully extinguished.

That said, severe drought conditions persist for almost all of Central Virginia and the neighboring Shenandoah Valley. While local states of emergency and burn bans instituted earlier in the fall are being lifted, officials are warning that residents should remain mindful of the extremely dry conditions, even with recent rain.

Drinking water reservoirs in the area remain at satisfactory levels, but farmers in the region have reported limited groundwater.

The Quaker Run Fire was ignited near the village of Syria in Madison County on Oct. 24. It quickly spread into the nearby Shenandoah National Park and prompted voluntary evacuation orders for some Madison County residents. It was declared fully contained Nov. 17, more than three weeks later, after burning through nearly 4,000 acres of public, private and park land.

The local state of emergency, declared on Oct. 25, and countywide burn, declared on Nov. 7, were lifted on Nov. 28 at the order of the Madison County Board of Supervisors.

“While conditions have improved the potential for wildfire spread still exists,” reads a statement from Madison County Emergency Management. “Current conditions will lessen the chances of aggressive spread but please use caution when burning.”

The severe drought in Central Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley has had a considerable impact on groundwater, according to farmers in the area.

Albemarle County Supervisor Ann Mallek, a rancher herself, has said she has heard from multiple farmers since the drought began to worsen.

“The report from a number of farms is that pastures set aside (stockpiled) for winter use are dried up or have been used early by necessity,” Mallek told The Daily Progress via email. “Some streams which would be expected to be four feet wide and flowing six inches deep are totally dry. Pressurized water systems that rely on spring water are failing. People living with wells are worried.”

Aquifers of ground water are connected underground. When one person draws excess water, it affects what is available for others.

“No one should waste water as that can take away a life sustaining water supply from a neighbor,” Mallek said.

The light rain the area has seen in recent weeks has not been enough to lift drought conditions. And when rain does come, it can create problems of its own after prolonged bouts of dry weather.

“The deep loss of ground water in drought situations translates to long recovery times when it does rain,” Mallek said. “Streams do not fill quickly as much of the gentle rain sinks deep into parched earth. Heavy downpours become run off and do not stay in the area.”

The reservoirs that supply drinking water for much of Central Virginia have been largely unharmed by the ongoing drought, according to officials.

“The reservoirs were designed to survive these dryer periods,” David Tungate, director of operations for Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority, told The Daily Progress.

Tungate said that despite the drought, reservoirs such as the 433 million-gallon Beaver Creek Reservoir, the source for Crozet water, has only ever been down a foot or two during the drought.

“If the Beaver Creek Reservoir watershed did not get another drop of rain, 433 million gallons is enough source water for more than 500 days of normal water supply demands in the Crozet water system,” Tungate said. “That’s what they’re designed to do. They hold the water back.”'",climate,drought

"'The 35-foot DirecTV Rose Parade float that will carry El Segundo’s Little League World Series champions on New Year’s Day is starting to show its colors.

This is the second in a photo series depicting the evolution of a Rose Parade float, from building the structure with steel, rebar and foam to the sweet-scented, fresh floral decor.

When we checked in at the Artistic Entertainment Services float building facility in Azusa last week, we were met with something that looked a little more like the finished product that will roll down 5.5 miles of Pasadena’s Colorado Boulevard carrying the South Bay’s hometown heroes.

Heidi Hoff, marketing director with AES, said they call this phase of float building “decorate by color.”

This is when the paint and art department are fully involved in the process.

Large and small swaths of the float are painted with the color of the flowers that will grace its surface. This, said Hoff, serves a dual purpose. One: so that the supervisors and volunteers placing flowers know which color goes where. And, two: if by chance the fresh petals aren’t tightly enough packed, that you’re seeing on a color underneath, and no bare spots.

The next step for DirecTV’s “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” float is to have teams start to glue on dried materials such as nuts and seeds. At the back of the float, for example, to depict part of the black for the baseball stadium, workers will glue poppy seeds.

The dry goods, of course, don’t wilt or turn brown.

So the fresh flower placement is done as close to parade time as possible — floral decorating week: Dec. 26 to Dec. 31.

In a couple weeks, “Let’s Take Me Out to the Ballgame” will move in the middle of the night from its Azusa home to its new decorating home near Rose Bowl stadium.

And, our photographer will be there as DirecTV’s entry blooms with fresh white mums, pink and red roses, ti leaf, ferns, lilies, orchids and snapdragons.'",sports,baseball
"'The New York Liberty need to find a way to even up the series after getting picked apart by Vegas in Game 1. Jackie Young had a stellar opening game, but our WNBA picks expect the Liberty to keep her off the perimeter in Game 2.

Photo By - USA TODAY Sports

Sparks flew in Game 1 of the WNBA Championship, as a superstar performance by Jackie Young led the Las Vegas Aces to a convincing 99-82 victory over the New York Liberty. With Game 2 on Wednesday, the Liberty approach must-win territory, as the Aces have not lost three straight games since 2020.

WNBA odds once again favor the Aces at home, but there are reasons to still believe in this New York squad.

My WNBA picks for Game 2 of Liberty vs. Aces believe New York will mix in new coverages to contain Young’s scoring.

Liberty vs Aces Game 2 best odds

Liberty vs Aces Game 2 picks and predictions

When the New York Liberty got off to a relatively shaky start this season, it became clear that they had a key weakness opposing teams would look to exploit: The starting backcourt of Sabrina Ionescu and Courtney Vandersloot are not strong defensively. And I mean that both figuratively and literally.

For most opponents, and for most of the year, that weakness could be counterbalanced by virtue of incredible interior defense and rim protection via the combination of Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones. For teams with an ace perimeter scorer, Betnijah Laney could take them on.

Few opponents had so many perimeter scoring options that the weakness at the point of attack by Sabrina and Sloot would become a fatal flaw. But the Las Vegas Aces, the team New York was put together to beat, are too well rounded.

Reigning Finals MVP Chelsea Gray is too strong and too crafty for either Ionescu or Vandersloot to handle, which is why Laney drew her assignment in Game 1. But after Gray, then there is Kelsey Plum. Even if one of Sabrina or Sloot can hang with Plum, or a combination of hard hedging and recovering can limit her drives and pull-up game, that still leaves Jackie Young.

Young is incredibly strong for her size too, and she’s also become one of the best 3-point shooters in the W. That combination allowed her to break out for 26 points on 15 shots in Game 1, something the Liberty cannot afford on Wednesday. But there are reasons to believe Young won’t have a repeat performance.

New York is likely to respond with new levels of cross matching on Wednesday. They can ask for more from 6-foot-1 Kayla Thornton, who played just eight minutes in Game 1, or it can get really radical and shift Stewart onto either Gray or Young, allowing her to plug a hole on the perimeter.

Adding more size and length without sacrificing speed or agility is one surefire way to limit the number of threes Young can attempt. Her big scoring games this season have all seen her take and make a lot of threes, including her 5-for-8 blitz in Game 1. New York has the luxury of adding length on the perimeter without sacrificing much on the interior because Jones can be waiting in drop.

Young’s breakout performance was the story of Game 1, but the Liberty have a lot of options they can turn to now that they’ve seen what it looks like when Jackie gets going. I’m expecting a series of matchup adjustments that seek to deny Young the kind of looks she thrived on in Game 1.

Young is averaging 15.1 points per game over her last 10 outings and has only scored over 18 points in three of those contests. I believe a locked-in New York team keeps a lid on Jackie’s scoring in Game 2.

My best bet: Young Under 18.5 points (+102 at FanDuel)

Liberty vs Aces Game 2 spread and Over/Under analysis

The spread for Game 2 is in line with that of Game 1 but is available anywhere between -4.5 and -5.5 in favor of Las Vegas depending on the sportsbook. The Aces looked extremely impressive in their Game 1 win, and much of what they did well could be sustainable.

As a team, Vegas finished 54.7% from the field, 40.9% from three, and 87% from the foul line.

While that level of shooting might be due for some regression, the team was generating excellent shots.The Aces were consistently getting good penetration on drives, moving the ball well, and finding cutters and easy buckets at the rim.

Meanwhile, the Liberty have stumbled to a 1-5 against the spread record in their last six games against teams with a winning record. Vegas meanwhile remain indomitable at home, going 4-1 ATS in its last five in Michelob Ultra Arena.

Unlike the variability in the spread, the total for Wednesday is hovering almost uniformly at 171.5. The total for Game 1 easily eclipsed that number at 181, and even with some regression by the Aces, that could easily be made up for by improvement from New York’s offense.

The Liberty were below average from everywhere on the court on Sunday, but they did generate 29 three-point attempts. They hit only nine, and if those go in at closer to a 40% clip, suddenly this line looks way undersold. Jones missed all three of her attempts from outside, critical shots that could help open driving lanes for New York’s guards.

There’s also the potential for Sabrina to get going on offense. The Aces did a nice job of throwing different coverages at her, including blitzing her regularly. The Liberty can be better at responding to the Aces' ball pressure in those spots by repositioning themselves on the floor. If that leads to Sabrina shaking loose, this line goes Over again just as it has in New York’s last four games.

"'Referee Halil Umut Meler was punched after the final whistle of MKE Ankaragucu's Turkish Super Lig game in Ankara

One of Turkey's top football officials may quit the game after he was physically attacked on the pitch by the president of an Ankara club and its fans.

The violent attack on elite referee Halil Umut Meler has left Turkish football in full-blown crisis and magnified concerns about Turkey's institutions.

The referee was treated in hospital after he was punched in the face by MKE Ankaragucu president Faruk Koca, after the Ankara-based team conceded a late equaliser in the Turkish capital against Super Lig rivals Caykur Rizespor.

While the referee lay injured, furious fans then stormed on to the pitch and kicked him. Meler told local media that after Faruk Koca had punched him under his left eye, he said: ""I will kill you."" Ankaragucu's club president has resigned and been placed in pre-trial detention with two others.

The dramatic events after the final whistle underscore the intense emotions surrounding football in Turkey. The sport is massively popular in the country of 85 million people and is a platform that links Turkish politics, business and culture.

The attack has prompted the 37-year old referee on Uefa's elite list to contemplate quitting, according to Ali Kunak, former general secretary of the Turkish Football Federation's central arbitration board, who spoke to Meler and local media on Tuesday.

The violence has also led to an indefinite suspension of Turkish Super Lig games.

The Turkish Football Federation, in a post on X, said it condemned the ""inhumane, despicable attack"", which it blamed in part on ""irresponsible statements of club presidents, managers, coaches, and TV commentators targeting referees"".

Violence has long been associated with Turkish football, where it is common to see a heavy police presence at matches across the country.

In March, six people were arrested for clashes involving fireworks before and after a match between Bursa's Bursaspor and Diyarbakir's Amedspor. And last September, a fan burst on to the pitch and violently kicked a Besiktas player following a match against Ankaragucu.

""Football is not only football,"" said Ozgehan Senuva, professor of international relations at Ankara's Middle East Technical University. ""This is only a reflection of the general social situation in Turkey.""

Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya visited referee Halil Umut Meler in hospital on Tuesday

Many Turks and the country's Western allies worry about President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's tightening grip on Turkey's key institutions, including the judicial system. More than 20 years of Erdogan rule has left a deepening mistrust and sense of injustice that goes way beyond football.

The vast bulk of Turkey's media is controlled by the Erdogan government - 90%, according to Reporters Without Borders - but football has turned into a key venue for political discourse.

""People don't trust the referees and how the referees are appointed. That goes in parallel with the low levels of trust in the judicial system,"" said Prof Senuva.

But the violence shown towards Halil Umut Meler ""is a new threshold for Turkish football"", according to Omer Turan, an international relations professor at Istanbul's Bilgi University. ""Referees are almost always the scapegoat used to explain unsuccessful results,"" he said.

Prof Turan pointed out that Faruk Koca, 59, is a former Ankara MP and a current member of President Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development party (AKP).

Faruk Koca is a former MP with the president's ruling party

""[Faruk Koca] thought that being an AKP member would give him immunity. This proved to be a miscalculation,"" he said.

There was a swift reaction to Monday night's attack from Turkey's president, his AKP, and the justice department.

President Erdogan posted on X: ""Sports means peace and brotherhood… We will never allow violence to take place in Turkish sports.""

Faruk Koca initially complained to Turkish media that the incident had ""developed due to the referee's wrong decisions and provocative behaviour"".

However, he said later in a statement on the club website he was deeply saddened that ""the club I manage, the football community, and our country are remembered with such an event and image"".

He also apologised to the referee, his family and the wider Turkish nation for his attitude.

The justice ministry is investigating the issue and the AKP's disciplinary board is considering a request from the party for Mr Koca's expulsion.

But Turkey's judiciary has long been criticised for its lack of independence and Prof Senuva says the general mood, especially on social media, is that Faruk Koca's connections may ease his path through the courts.

""This is who he is. And this is the culture of [his] club as well. They are proud of being tough guys: it's part of the club's DNA.""'",sports,football

“You want to play at a high level. But then family is a lot. My son is 16 and then two girls. So, [I’m] looking forward to seeing them grow up in those important years.”

Iguodala, 39, was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers at No. 9 overall in the 2004 NBA Draft and averaged 15.3 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game during his eight seasons with the franchise.

"'After record-breaking heat in July and a meager monsoon season, Arizona’s long-term drought has been expanded.

Example video title will go here for this video

Next up in 5

ARIZONA, USA — A new drought statement issued by the National Weather Service has some sobering news about the state of the drought in Arizona.

After record-breaking heat in July and a meager monsoon season, State Forty-Eight’s long-term drought has been expanded. However, the upside is the potential for rain El Nino will bring this winter.

According to the latest information coming in from the tropics, a moderate to strong El Nino is taking shape. That means wetter than normal conditions are expected into Spring 2024.

Yuma, La Paz, Mohave, and northern Coconino counties continued to receive above-average precipitation at the end of the monsoon season, while areas along the Mogollon Rim to the White Mountains, northern Apache, eastern Pima, western Cochise, and Santa Cruz counties received below-average precipitation.

Mohave and Coconino were the only counties with near-normal temperatures in September. Maricopa and most southeastern counties had temperatures much above average, while Santa Cruz and portions of Cochise, Graham, Greenlee counties had record warm temps.

After a year, Extreme (D3) short-term drought returned to the state in Santa Cruz County and portions of Maricopa, Gila, Pima, Cochise, Graham, and Greenlee counties (6% of the state).

Moderate (D1) and Severe (D2) short-term drought advanced in central, southern, and eastern counties (45% of the state).

Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions (41% of the state) largely remained in western and northern counties, with areas of no drought (8% of the state) continuing in portions of central Coconino, northwestern Mohave, and southern Yuma counties.

Summer extremes expanded Arizona’s long-term drought.

Exceptional (D4) long-term drought persisted in southern La Paz County but also started developing in central Maricopa and southwestern Santa Cruz counties.

Extreme (D3) long-term drought advanced in Maricopa and portions of Yuma, La Paz and southeastern Coconino counties.

Southern Mohave, central La Paz, Yuma, and Maricopa counties expanded Severe (D2) long-term drought.

Pima and Pinal counties and areas along the Mogollon Rim to the White Mountains developed a Moderate (D1) long-term drought.

Portions of northern Mohave, northern to central Coconino, northern Navajo and Apache, and Cochise counties still contained smaller areas of Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions or areas without long-term drought.

"'FILE - Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, left, gives thumbs up as he stands with his older brother Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani on the podium after the World Cup final soccer match between Argentina and France at the Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, Sunday, Dec. 18, 2022. Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is withdrawing his offer to buy Manchester United, a person with knowledge of the process told The Associated Press. (AP Photo/Hassan Ammar, File)

Qatar’s Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani is withdrawing his offer to buy storied soccer club Manchester United, a person with knowledge of the process told The Associated Press on Saturday.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions around the process.

Sheikh Jassim had been one of the leading contenders to complete a takeover of the Premier League club, which was put up for sale last year.

Along with British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, the Qatari banker was one of only two bidders to publicly declare their intention to buy out United owners, the Glazer family.

But almost a year since bids were invited for the 20-time English league champions, Sheikh Jassim has informed the Glazers he is withdrawing his offer, the person said.

The person said Sheikh Jassim’s final bid was almost double United’s current market valuation of $3.2 billion.

Ratcliffe’s offer remains in place, although it has been reported that he is prepared to accept a minority stake.

The Associated Press contacted United and merchant bank Raine, which is handling the sale process, for comment.

Sheikh Jassim’s decision comes as United fans have grown increasingly frustrated with the time taken to complete the proposed sale.

There have been fan protests outside the club’s Old Trafford stadium, urging its American owners to sell, while chants of “Glazers out” are regularly heard during games.

“MUFC is in desperate need of new investment and new majority ownership. We hope this news accelerates that process rather than delays it,” Manchester United Supporters Trust said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Based on the last 11 months, no one can be quite sure.

“The Glazers need to make their position clear.”

The Glazers announced in November plans to seek new investment, instructing Raine to oversee the process, which included the potential of a full sale.

Raine had conducted the sale of Chelsea to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital last year.

It was anticipated a buyer would be confirmed in time for the off-season transfer window, but there has been no indication of a deal nearing completion.

Sheikh Jassim, the chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and son of a former Qatari prime minister, was bidding to take 100% ownership of United, which appealed to fans who are desperate to say goodbye to the Glazers.

He also vowed to clear its debt, while investing in the stadium, training center and playing squads in a bid to “return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch.”

While concerns had been raised about Qatar’s human rights record and the potential that United could be used as a so-called sportswashing project, fans wanted to see the club compete with the exorbitant spending of Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City, which completed a treble of trophies last season by winning the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

The person said Sheikh Jassim’s decision came after latest discussions to try to reach agreement over a price. His withdrawal would appear to leave Ratcliffe in pole position, although it is not clear how much of a stake in the club he is trying to buy.

Ratcliffe, who is the owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS and is one of Britain’s richest people, had bid for the Glazers’ stake of about 69%, but reports later claimed the current owners could retain some of their shares as part of the takeover.

Recent reports have since claimed Ratcliffe is now prepared to take a minority stake, which would leave the Glazers in control.

Born in Failsworth, Greater Manchester, Ratcliffe has been a United fan since childhood. United supporters have long-hoped he would bid for the club, but a deal that involves the Glazers retaining a majority ownership would not be well-received by supporters who want a full sale.

United fans have long campaigned to drive out the Glazers, who also own the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The late tycoon Malcolm Glazer bought United in 2005 for 790 million pounds (then about $1.4 billion) amid a backlash from fans.

United is currently 10th in the Premier League after a difficult start to the season for Erik ten Hag’s team.

SESKLO, Greece (Reuters) - The fires came first. Then the floods.

In the small village of Sesklo in central Greece, 46-year old Vasilis Tsiamitas has felt the extremes of both freak weather phenomena this summer, that have made Greece a climate change hotspot.

Storm Elias flooded his house, damaged his beach bar and swept away his car in September, finishing off what was left weeks earlier by Storm Daniel, Greece's most intense on record, and a July wildfire that scorched his family almond grove.

""God only knows how I will get past this,"" said Tsiamitas, standing outside his two-storey family house. The front door is off its hinges, propped up against a wall next to wooden boards soaked by floodwater.

""What else could hit me? It can't get any worse,"" he told Reuters.

Fierce storms and floods have become more frequent in recent years while rising temperatures make summers hotter and drier, creating tinder-box conditions for wildfires.

Muddy roads and household furniture stacked up outside to dry in villages across the central mainland region of Thessaly, are a constant reminder of the steps Greece needs to take as it adapts to climate change to mitigate the impact of such freak weather events.

Sesklo, a village of about 800 residents near the port city of Volos and home to one of Europe's oldest prehistoric settlements, has survived natural disasters through the centuries.

But its eldest residents, Tsiamitas says, have never experienced anything like this year's devastation.

""It's the first time that our village is tested so much,"" said Tsiamitas, who is also the local community leader. ""We have elderly people sitting at the village square who are 95 years old, 90 years old, they have never experienced such a thing before.""

START FROM SCRATCH

The wildfire that broke out in July was burning uncontrolled for at least two days.

Sesklo residents were evacuated in time but the flames, fanned by strong winds, burned through farmland and groves destroying approximately 70% of the village's almond and olive oil production, said Tsiamitas.

""The weather conditions were so bad, the wind, there was no humidity that day, the fire was moving fast. There was not enough time to do anything,"" he said.

In early September, Storm Daniel hit Thessaly after Greece's longest heatwave in more than 30 years. It killed 16 people and turned the area into an inland sea, destroying homes, farms, and wiping out swathes of crops.

Tsiamitas, whose beach bar flooded, said most Sesklo residents were not as badly affected as others in the wider region. But their feeling of relief was short-lived.

Weeks later, Elias, a less intense but unexpected storm was the final straw.

Tsiamitas recounts that he had his youngest son in his arms when a raging torrent flung his front door open, forcing him to race upstairs where his in-laws live.

Since then, the water has subsided, revealing the devastation that villages like Sesklo suffered.

""We should learn our lesson,"" Tsiamitas said, looking at stumps of burnt almond trees. ""We need to uproot them ... we need to plant them again. Again and again, we need to start everything from scratch.""

"'On Monday night, newly retired Tigers great Miguel Cabrera took part in the Venezuelan edition of the home run derby. The festivities at La Rinconada Stadium in Caracas were designed to celebrate Venezuela’s favorite baseball son. Top Venezuelan players like Ronald Acuña Jr., Eugenio Suarez, and Brewers top prospect Jackson Chourio all honored Cabrera as a national baseball icon in statements to the press around the event, and the players all wore number 24 in tribute.

Acuña Jr., as one might expect, took home the crown in the home run derby in a something of a fitting transfer of the mantle of best active Venezuelan player. Pitted against a red hot Yasiel Puig in the first round, Cabrera was unable to advance, but as it turns out, that may not be the last time Venezuelan fans get to see him playing baseball in his home country.

The Venezuelan Professional Baseball League is already well underway this season, but Cabrera told reporters at the derby that he hopes to take the next 10 months to get his right knee in better condition and then play a final pro season for Tigres de Aragua in 2024-2025.

Per report and translation from Daniel Alvarez-Montes of El Extrabase, Cabrera has a plan in mind. ”I’m going to prepare properly, plan my final season next year and make it big like it was in the U.S.”

Cabrera hasn’t played for Tigres de Aragua since the 2007-2008 season, right before coming to Detroit from the Miami Marlins.

Since his emotional farewell in Detroit, Cabrera has filled his social media with clips of he and his kids at their various sporting events and appears fully in Dad-mode. Particularly after watching the still excellent pure hitter struggle to hit off his back the past few seasons, it’s a bit of surprise to hear him planning on playing another season, albeit a much shorter one than an MLB season, in Venezuela.

Hopefully the knee is willing, as conducting a farewell tour at home and trying to lead his young teammates to a Venezuelan League championship would be a really cool, and fitting addendum to his major league career.'",sports,baseball

"'BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Lloyd Owers recalls with fondness his initial visit from his home in England to the Marshall Islands, a small nation of five islands, 29 atolls and about 60,000 people situated in the western Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Australia.

“I felt at home,” the 33-year-old soccer coach said of his first impressions. “The community welcomed me with open arms.""

Owers wasn’t there as a widely-traveled Brit checking it out as a tourist. He was appointed technical director of the Marshall Islands Soccer Federation in December of last year, and was making his first official visit in August in that capacity.

Oh, by the way, the Marshall Islands has no national soccer team. It's been touted as the “last country on Earth” without international representation in the sport.

“Yes,” Owers reiterates in emailed correspondence with The Associated Press. “We are the only U.N.-recognized nation that have never had a national representative team.”

Enter Owers, a well-credentialled coach based in Oxfordshire in southeast England and who has provided his expertise to teams in Canada, the U.S. and Sweden, among others.

The Marshall Islands are not a member of FIFA, soccer's international governing body. The country’s first attempt to join an official regional soccer organization could come with the Oceania Football Confederation or the Asian Football Confederation.

“We are still exploring all available options to us,” Owers says. “OFC and AFC are both viable options. We hope to progress into more talks during 2024 but at this stage we are still in the planning phase to ensure that we are fully prepared.”

The preparation has begun, with soccer officials in the country and Owers planning a grassroots-level entree into the sport via the country's schools.

""The soccer federation has already agreed with the ministry of education to add soccer to the school sports curriculum alongside volleyball and basketball,"" Shem Livai, president of the Marshall Islands Soccer Federation, told the AP. “To enable school teachers to deliver high-quality coaching sessions we will be training teachers to be qualified soccer coaches through a combination of online and in-person courses.”

Livai says there are about 6,000 children who live on Majuro Atoll — the largest and capital island — and about 12,000 children are spread across all of the islands.

“Eventually we want them all to have the opportunity to play football or futsal,” Livai says.

Owers, who is very active on social media, is doing his part, posting a request for his followers to donate balls, bibs, cones and goals to help out the fledgling program in the Marshall Islands.

Otherwise, Owers' posts on X, formerly known as Twitter, might leave all but seasoned soccer followers, players and/or the sport's tacticians baffled. Here is a recent one.

The Marshall Islands, about 4,300 kilometers (2,600 miles) northeast of the 2032 Olympic host city Brisbane, Australia, have a long history with the United States, and Owers thinks that might be a plus in soccer becoming popular there.

After gaining military control of the Marshall Islands from Japan in 1944, the U.S. assumed administrative control of the islands following the end of World War II. The economy of the Marshall Islands is still closely linked to the U.S. and its gross domestic product is derived mainly from U.S. payments — the U.S. Army garrison on Kwajalein Atoll is the No. 2 employer in the islands behind the Marshall Islands government.

Between 1946 and 1958, the U.S. used the Marshall Islands as an atomic bomb testing ground. During that time, 67 atomic bombs were dropped there.

The Marshall Islands signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States in 1983 and gained independence in 1986, when the Compact agreement came into force. The Republic of the Marshall Islands is now a sovereign nation.

“There’s obviously nothing to hide from that because it’s part of their culture, it’s part of the history,” Owers told the BBC of the American connection. ""There’s a fully functioning U.S. military base in Kwajalein. It’s part of their identity and, because it’s very heavily U.S. cultured, there is a lot of interest in sports such as baseball and basketball.

“But now with football, or soccer, because that has grown in the States, it has also grown on the Marshall Islands. The federation wants to eventually become a FIFA member. They don’t just want to be playing against local countries, they want to be part of a bigger program.""

Owers, who played semi-professionally, plans to travel again from England to the Marshall Islands early in 2024. It's Step 2 and a work in progress until he has a team to coach.

“I can’t wait to get back,” he says.

"'Usher thanked Rihanna for her support ahead of his Super Bowl performance.

The singer is following in Rihanna’s footsteps by performing at the upcoming Super Bowl halftime show, and he’s thanked the chart-topping star for her recent show of support.

In response to a video message from the Fenty founder, “Real recognize real Thank U Queen @rihanna,” Usher wrote on X.

In the video, Rihanna hailed Usher as a “legend.”

“I can’t give Usher no advice. Usher is a natural, he’s a legend and he’s been doing this since he’s a teenager,” Rihanna replied when asked if she had any tips for him.

The “Umbrella” hitmaker also believes he’s perfectly suited to performing the halftime show.

“He’s made for that show. I get excited about entertainers who do this, who are built for it. And he just proved that in Vegas that he’s not going anywhere,” she said.

Meanwhile, Rihanna previously revealed that she “totally forgot about Valentine’s Day” before her Super Bowl performance.

The star has been with A$AP Rocky since 2020, but the Super Bowl became the focus of her attention ahead of her performance in February.

“I’ve been so focused on the Super Bowl, I totally forgot that my birthday is coming up,” she told CBS. “I totally forgot about Valentine’s Day. I am just like Super Bowl, Super Bowl, Super Bowl. It’s a lot of preparation, a lot of moving parts.”

“This is the week that it really is being tested,” Rihanna continued. “Everyone, we’re just tightening up everything. Everybody is dialing in; everybody is tuning up. And a lot of moving parts. I mean, it’s literally like three to four hundred people breaking the stage down and building it back up and getting it out in eight minutes. It’s incredible.

"'Megan Thee Stallion’s ex-boyfriend Parison “Pardi” Fontaine has apparently responded to the heatwave of hate he has incurred after the Houston Hottie released her sizzling single, “Cobra.”

In making a song that correlates an unfaithful man with the regal snake, Megan referred to her man stepping out on her, in her bed, in her own house, inciting throngs of Megan fans to scorch the ex-lover on social media.

“Pulled up, caught him cheatin’/ Gettin’ his d— sucked in the same spot I’m sleepin’/ Lord, give me a break, I don’t know how much more of this s— I can take.

Since Megan has not come out to clarify whether or not she was referencing Pardi, fans have assumed that he was whom she was talking about. The tidal wave of backlash forced Pardi to cut off the comments section of his nearly 1 million-strong Instagram page.

This was Megan’s first solo single of 2023. She dialed it back this year to nurse the accumulative emotional wounds she suffered during the tumultuous Tory Lanez legal process and other personal angst that might include the termination of her romance with Pardi. Lanez was convicted just before Christmas in 2022 of firing the gun that injured both of Megan’s feet in the summer of 2020. On Aug. 8, 2023, Lanez was sentenced to 10 years in prison and will most likely be deported to his Canadian homeland after he is freed.

In terms of Pardi, there were rampant rumors that Megan parted ways with Pardi back at the beginning of 2023 due to alleged domestic violence, which Pardi adamantly denies.

“Stop this cap nobody puttin hands on nobody … (At least not in that way),” he wrote on his Instagram Stories at the time. “Been seein the break up rumors and was lettin y’all imaginations run ..but y’all gettin too crazy ….ain’t give n—- a story so they made one … we really been on it double time.”'",climate,heatwave
"'It was a longball party Wednesday in Philadelphia, as the Phillies clobbered six home runs — tying the record for most in a game in MLB postseason history — en route to a 10-2 Game 3 demolishing of the Braves and a 2-1 lead in this NLDS. They'll have a chance to clinch their ticket for an NLCS return at home in Thursday's Game 4.

It was arguably even more of a longball party later on in Arizona. The Diamondbacks slugged four homers in one inning — setting an MLB postseason record — en route to a 4-2 victory and a 3-0 series sweep, sending them on to the NLCS for the first time since 2007 and the Dodgers home for a long winter.

No. 2 Los Angeles Dodgers at No. 6 Arizona Diamondbacks, Game 3: D-backs 4, Dodgers 2 (Arizona wins 3-0)

Game summary:

The Diamondbacks have ended the Dodgers’ season. They didn’t make it look particularly difficult.

After steamrolling Clayton Kershaw in Game 1 and pouncing on Bobby Miller in Game 2, the D-backs made history against Lance Lynn (more on that below), getting all the runs they would need in the third inning and further pushing the Dodgers' pitching staff into ignominy for the series. Per Elias Sports Bureau, no team has ever received fewer innings from its starting pitchers in the first three games of a series than the 4⅔ contributed by Dodgers starters in this NLDS.

Up 4-0 after their third-inning onslaught, the D-backs got 4⅓ innings with only two hits and no runs allowed from rookie Brandon Pfaadt. The Arizona bullpen mostly kept the Dodgers down from there, with the lone exception being four straight two-out singles that scored two runs in the seventh inning.

Unfortunately for L.A., four singles in an inning aren’t worth as much as four home runs.

THE ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS HAVE SWEPT THE DODGERS AND ARE GOING TO THE NLCS! pic.twitter.com/4cHcDDSU5D — Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) October 12, 2023

Key moment:

It was actually a series of moments in the third inning, as the Diamondbacks became the first team ever to hit four home runs in one inning of postseason play. The first three homers came from Geraldo Perdomo, Ketel Marte and Christian Walker.

Perhaps the most emphatic was the last of the bunch. Gabriel Moreno hit a ball that was initially called a home run, then overturned to a foul ball. No matter. On the very next pitch he saw, Moreno hit another home run — for real this time.

Impact player:

Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. For all the wrong reasons.

Two players who will likely finish in the top four in NL MVP voting contributed nothing on offense for the third straight game. They finished the series a combined 1-for-21, with the lone hit being a Freeman infield single.

The low point came in the eighth inning Wednesday, when Kolten Wong worked a leadoff walk with Betts and then Freeman due up as the potential tying run. Both struck out against D-backs reliever Kevin Ginkel, taking the Dodgers’ last hope of a comeback with them.

What’s next?

The 100-win Dodgers are out of the playoffs, and the Arizona Diamondbacks are on to the NLCS. They’ll have four days off before facing the winner of Phillies-Braves in Game 1 on Monday.

No. 1 Atlanta Braves at No. 4 Philadelphia Phillies, Game 3: Phillies 10, Braves 2 (Philadelphia leads 2-1)

Game summary:

What might've seemed like a pitchers’ game in the first two innings quickly turned into a home run derby in the bottom of the third. Nick Castellanos got things started for Philly with a leadoff homer to tie the game 1-1 after the Braves had scored on a Ronald Acuña Jr. double and Ozzie Albies single in the top half of the inning.

Then, after singles from Brandon Marsh and Trea Turner, Bryce Harper proceeded to hit a three-run shot that put Philadelphia ahead 4-1. Two batters later, the Phillies knocked Braves starter Bryce Elder out of the game. Reliever Michael Tonkin inherited Alec Bohm and Bryson Stott and was tasked with getting the final out of the inning. He instead conceded an RBI double to J.T. Realmuto that made it 6-1.

The next two frames passed largely without incident until Harper launched his second home run of the game into center field in the fifth. 7-1 Philadelphia.

Atlanta responded feebly, with an RBI single from Orlando Arcia that cut Philadelphia’s lead to 7-2 in the sixth. But the Phillies got the run back on a Turner home run to center field in the bottom of the inning and then tacked on two more homers from Castellanos and Marsh in the eighth, making it 10-2 and sending the Phillies faithful into pandemonium.

WE'RE WORKING AS FAST AS WE CAN THX FOR YOUR PATIENCE pic.twitter.com/BORR2yVq4J — Philadelphia Phillies (@Phillies) October 12, 2023

Key moment:

The Phillies’ six-run third inning both gave the team the lead and all but put things out of reach for the Braves. The key blow was the three-run homer from Harper that plated Turner and Marsh.

BRYCE HARPER DEMOLISHED! THAT WAS OBVIOUS! pic.twitter.com/ALs38vPB5V — Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) October 11, 2023

With that swing, Harper changed the tenor of the ballpark – igniting the crowd to maximum volume – and essentially ended Elder’s night, even though manager Brian Snitker left him in for a couple more batters.

Impact player:

The one and only Bryce Harper. A bona fide postseason force, Harper put his stamp on Game 3 early, with the three-run shot that made the game the Phillies’ to lose. He made his presence known again in the fifth, with the towering homer to center, and he came close to a third home run with a deep flyout in the bottom of the sixth.

With the two home runs, Harper set the record for homers in NLDS history, with 10 in his career (passing Braves great Chipper Jones) in just 26 games. Game 3 was the first multihomer postseason game of Harper's career. He also now has the third-most home runs in Phillies playoff history, with nine — in just his second postseason with the team.

"'Nestled on the south side of Lake Ogallala State Recreation Area is Cedar Point Biological Station’s most recently built dwelling.

The building is unusual because the timber is almost entirely sourced from Cedar Point’s forest of eastern red cedar trees.

Sourcing the wood locally also has allowed the project to be carbon negative.

“When we calculated it, we embodied (released into the atmosphere) 6 tons of carbon,” said University of Nebraska-Lincoln graduate student Doug Rief. “But we sequestered 7.85. So it was a net gain of sequestered carbon when we got done. If we had done it traditionally, where we’re buying wood from say, Canada, which is where a lot of cross-laminated timber comes from, it would have been an excess, it would have actually created about 2 tons of carbon.”

The small cabin, called “Mizer’s Ruin,” has a “four-square” design, with housing occupying two of the squares, joined on the diagonal.

Two more squares make up individual porches facing the north or south, depending on the inhabitant’s destination.

The eastern red cedar that makes the bulk of the building is laid in square beams, stacked one on top of the other to form the walls, tied together with joining screws.

Dubbed a “micro-dwelling,” it is only 190 square feet in size. The external walls of the house were charred through a technique called “shou sugi ban,” which involves blackening the wood and applying oil as a preservative technique.

The structure was completed in partnership with UNL’s College of Architecture, and Associate Director of Cedar Point Biological Station Jon Garbisch encourages students to earn school credit through building projects at Cedar Point.

Ranging from biological studies to architecture and even artist retreats, the station gives students a chance to conduct field studies and projects in their respective majors, Garbisch said.

Architectural students are able to work on projects with wood harvested from Cedar Point. Students will cut down trees, mill the lumber on site and transport it back to Lincoln for later processing if needed. If not, they will use the lumber directly milled on-site for construction purposes.

“What the students and I were just doing today is just cutting the bark off, making these billet beams that we’ll then slice up into one-by material or two-by or three-by material,” Garbisch said. “And that wall in the bathroom they’re making here, they’ll grab a couple of those, slice them up into three-by tongue and groove going up.”

The house still needs some work. Grad students recently were working on utility hook-ups, framing a bed, sealing the walls with caulk and constructing the bathroom. They still need to install mosquito screens and add little details, such as trim around the windows.

According to a 2022 press release from UNL, the tiny home was first conceived in 2018, with further development in 2019 and finalization in fall 2021.

The Nebraska Environmental Trust awarded the project $28,412 in 2020. A release said the funding “resolves concerns about the environmental impact of eastern red cedar in Nebraska.”

The design has also been submitted to the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture Design-Build Award for consideration.

Rief said the goal was not only to make a house for grad students to work on, but also to see whether they could create something carbon negative.

The main consumer of carbon was transportation and processing, according to Rief.

“That’s one of the things we’d really like to get, more milling equipment up here, because it reduces our carbon footprint even more,” he said. “It costs us $50 a student just in gas to bring them up and take them back.”

One of the reasons Mizer’s Ruin received its name was the use of a Mizer sawmill to process the lumber. Mizers are portable mills intended for homesteading and locally sourcing timber.

“We’ve thought through so many different problems that we would come up against and have ideas about how we would do it again,” said Jason Griffiths, project lead and professor of architecture.

“The whole thinking behind the building was to use eastern red cedar and at the same time mitigate the threat of forest fire, particularly in canyons,” Griffiths said. “The idea was just to see if we could find some way in which the purpose of the timber and the way in which we think about it as a resource can be turned to a more positive tone.”

Garbisch said harvesting timber from such close proximity has two purposes: fire management and keeping captured carbon in its captured state, also known as carbon sequestration.

“If you had a 40-acre parcel that was full of older cedar trees, these dense cedar thickets, like we see in front of us, really are not usable habitat for the wildlife,” Garbisch said. He points to the sides of the canyon containing the biological station. It’s full of trees.

“We’ve removed at least 50% to 70% of the tree mass. Right now, after almost two years, you can’t hardly tell,” he said.

Eastern red cedar is not popular as a wood, Griffiths said. But he and the students set out to prove that the tree, normally regarded as an invasive species, can be useful.

“I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t think about it as building material.”

Griffiths said any advantages eastern red cedar has over the industry standard yellow pine is doubtful.

“Eastern red cedar should be seen as another timber source that is different from yellow pine. Harvesting is a specialized process because it is not grown under managed forestry,” he said.

The aim wasn’t to prove eastern red cedar’s advantage as a wood on the market, Griffiths said, but to show a house can be built while minimizing the carbon footprint required to build one. Locally sourcing materials means less in shipping and fuel consumption.

“If you reduce the amount of travel, you can sequester carbon and help reverse the buildup of greenhouse gases. But this idea of local construction also benefits local carpentry and forestry economically,” Griffiths said.

"'Naomi Osaka is back in Brisbane, Australia, as she prepares to make her highly anticipated return to tennis. The former world number one welcomed her daughter Shai into the world in July with her boyfriend, Cordae.







Less than six months later, the four-time grand slam champion is competing in the Australian Open, and she looks amazing.

On Wednesday, the athlete shared a video from her time at practice with her 2.7 million followers on Instagram. The 26-year-old Japanese tennis player looks strong, fast, and ready to compete.



The Australian Open will see the best tennis stars in the world, like Coco Gauff, compete with each other for the title. Angelique Kerber, also a former WTA number 1, will be making a comeback after welcoming her child in 2023.

Rafael Nadal will also make his anticipated return to Brisbane after his torturous injury a year ago at the Australian Open. He underwent surgery in June and said he would return when he was at the caliber to win.



Mother and champion

After pregnancy, Osaka said she was surprised by how much her body changed. She told InStyle it felt“unstable” with her joints “fragile” and a loose core. She put in the hard work to rebuild her body, power, and stamina.

"'WNBA and MLB participants in Fanatics’ Athlete Immersion Program: AJ Lewis, Walker Buehler, Rebekah Gardner, Isabelle Harrison, Essence Carson, Mark Melancon, Mike Rucker, Zach Weiss, Diamond DeShields, and Marie Ferdinand-Harris (back left to front right).

USC’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and Marshall School of Business joined the global digital sports platform Fanatics to create a one-week innovative career transition program for WNBA and MLB athletes. Combining the global business expertise of Fanatics with USC’s academic strength and deep connections to the sports industry, the collaboration aimed to accelerate athletes’ transition into business careers through a customized educational experience.

Serving as an academic hub for the global sports industry, USC Annenberg and USC Marshall immersed participants in a specialized curriculum to gain a comprehensive understanding of business fundamentals, brand strategy, sales and marketing, and storytelling. Fanatics offered athletes exposure to the entirety of its wide-ranging portfolio, including access to top executives in these various divisions.

By blending the academic excellence of USC’s faculty and real-world application in Fanatics’ offices, athletes develop both theoretical and practical experience in the sports business. The program plans to build a diverse talent pipeline for positions at Fanatics and leadership roles across the sports ecosystem.

“Whether it’s fan engagement, opportunities offered by the expansion of streaming platforms, or the influx of capital investments, we’re watching in real time as the sports industry explodes with opportunity,” USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said. “We are proud to support Fanatics’ Athlete Immersion Program with a curriculum that equips athletes with a comprehensive understanding of the sector and propels their professional growth.”

Monica Koyama, co-director of USC Annenberg's Communication Management program, leads a session focusing on brand communication and media.

USC Annenberg’s communication and public relations faculty members introduced participants to media and brand communications, preparing them to tell brand stories — both the personal and the corporate — through creative multimedia content across diverse digital media platforms.

Providing a foundation in business and marketing fundamentals, USC Marshall’s faculty engaged the cohort around best leadership practices, as well as strategies to build, manage, and maintain high-performing, diverse teams.

“Sports are at the center of so much in our world, from boardrooms to playing fields,” USC Marshall Dean Geoffrey Garrett said. “And with this exciting new partnership, Fanatics and USC are creating pathways for professional athletes to transition successfully to their post-playing careers.”

Throughout the week, 11 MLB and WNBA athletes gained firsthand insights into areas such as merchandising, collectibles, and the “live” experience through conversations with Fanatics leaders, including Michael Rubin, CEO; Orlando Ashford, Chief People Officer; Mike Mahan, Fanatics Collectibles CEO; Nick Bell, Fanatics Live CEO; and Eli Kumekpor, Mitchell & Ness CEO.

“Fanatics’ business is built on our relationships with athletes. We’re proud to be able to support athletes at every stage of their career and help as they transition beyond the field or court,” Ashford said. “On behalf of the company, I’d like to give a big thank you to USC for lending their classrooms and expertise to make this program a success and provide incredible value to our WNBA and MLB participants.”

In an interview with PEOPLE, Dallas Wings player Diamond DeShields emphasized that value.

“Honestly, I loved everything about [the program],” she said. “Every day was just full of so much I was excited to learn. We got to learn so many things about the different businesses within Fanatics, Fanatics Collectibles, Fanatics Lives, everything that they had going on.”'",sports,basketball

On Fridy, starting at 9 p.m. Pender County Utilities customers west of Crooked Run Road and Highway 11 will be without water for approximately six to eight hours while bridge contractors tie in to the new water main that crosses under the creek.

During the outage, customers are asked to not operate water faucets to prevent air from entering their plumbing.

Prior to the water outage, PCU recommends fill pots on the stove for cooking, filling containers with potable drinking water — 1 gallon per person — and having some buckets of water on hand or flushing toilets.

Service will be restored as quickly as possible, according to PCU. Once it is, a boil advisory will be issued for the impacted residents until further notice.

All water used for human and pet consumption should be boiled for one minute prior to using. It’s not necessary to boil water for laundry or bathing.

Customers will be notified when the boil advisory has been lifted.

Drought is usually associated with lack of rainfall, but there are other factors, like snowmelt and groundwater, that can affect the water levels of streams and rivers.

In a new study, researchers from University of California, Riverside (UCR), found that drought impact can persist for as long as three-and-a-half years in rivers and streams despite precipitation from a series of storms, a press release from UCR said.

The total water level of streams is measured by two factors: total water level, affected by rainfall and snowmelt, and baseflow, the share fed by groundwater.

“People often just use rain as an indicator of drought because it’s easier to measure. But there are other kinds of drought that each have their own impacts,” said Hoori Ajami, the study’s corresponding author and associate professor of groundwater hydrology at UCR. “We needed a new way to see how long it takes for one form of drought to become another form.”

Baseflow droughts are studied by fewer researchers, and there had not previously been an accurate measurement technique for them. Since lack of baseflow significantly impacts ecosystem services, as well as water management, the researchers chose to turn their focus on this important aspect of hydrology.

The study, “Comprehensive assessment of baseflow responses to long-term meteorological droughts across the United States,” was published in the Journal of Hydrology.

The category of drought that affects rivers and streams is called hydrological drought, to which baseflow belongs. Baseflow impacts water availability for drinking, bathing and irrigation. It affects plants, wildlife and the overall health of ecosystems. Infrastructure stability could also be impacted by severe hydrological drought.

In order to develop a method for defining the start and end points of hydrological droughts in specific locations, the researchers looked at three decades’ worth of data from 350-plus locations around the U.S.

The research team only looked at baseflow on rivers and streams that did not have any dams or reservoirs and had not been impacted by human activity.

The results showed that a hydrological drought’s beginning and end is dependent on a variety of factors, including a location’s geography and typical climate.

A wide array of lag times were found between the end of a drought due to lack of rainfall and the conclusion of a baseflow drought. For instance, streams in parts of Kansas took 41 months to recover, but those in Pasadena’s Arroyo Seco area took nearly a year.

“When we are looking at water management strategies, it is clear we cannot implement a one-size-fits-all solution everywhere, for every stream. Our approaches need to be site specific,” said lead author of the study Sanghyun Lee, who is now a postdoctoral fellow with the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service in Oklahoma, in the press release. “When I first came to California in 2016, people asked me, ‘Is the drought over?’ They wanted to know if our watersheds had recovered. This new study shows it may take another few years until they get back to normal.”

The team’s results were consistent with earlier studies finding that water recovery in underground aquifers also experiences a delay in responding to lack of rainfall. Aquifers are an important water source for agriculture, as well as rivers’ baseflow.

Too much pumping of groundwater during drought could lead to sinkholes, which can cause shifts or even the collapse of buildings and other types of infrastructure.

“One key message we want to send is that people must be careful about managing the water they have,” Lee said in the press release. “Because of rising temperatures, baseflow drought is getting longer and more severe in many parts of the country. And because watershed boundaries often cross state or international lines, preserving precious water resources will require more cooperation.”'",climate,drought

"'NETTIE, W.Va. — Funeral services for a fallen Nicholas County firefighter will be held Saturday in the community of Nettie at the fire hall where he had dedicated the last two years of his life. Brody Hanna was killed Sunday in a collision with a drunken driver who was fleeing police in a stolen vehicle near Summersville.

“I was at home and got a phone call telling me it was one of my guys. They said it didn’t look good. I went to the hospital and was with the family when they were told he had passed. It was a gut wrencher,” said Steve Davis, Chief of the Nettie Volunteer Fire Department.

Hanna was a two year member of the fire department and according to Davis was extremely dedicated to his position. He would often seek out details to help out or look for classes he could take to increase his firefighter knowledge and skills. He was also heavily involved in the fire department’s fundraising efforts.

“He definitely was dedicated. Every fundraiser we had, when he first joined and we had bingo, he was there every Saturday night. Our other little events, he was always there,” Davis explained.

A testament to his dedication was how he died. According to Davis, Hanna happened to be in Summersville and heard about an accident not far away. Although not dispatched to the scene, he told his girlfriend he was going to go there to see if anyone needed help and if not would take the long way home. He was never able to make that long journey home since he was in a collision with suspect Dustin Young who was fleeing the accident scene in a stolen vehicle.

Young is now in jail facing an array of charges stemming from a long list of criminal activity that evening, including causing the accident which claimed Brody’s life.

Brody’s body is due to be released from the State Medical Examiner on Thursday and his fire department brothers and sisters will escort him home.

“We are sending trucks down to escort him back to Nicholas County along with other agencies,” said the Chief.

Final arrangements are being made, but services for Brody are planned Saturday at the bingo hall next door to the Nettie Fire House.

Brody’s death marks another tragedy in Nicholas County. Another member of the Nettie VFD, Travis Lawson was killed in May in a motorcycle accident. Division of Forestry firefighter Cody Mullins who was killed battling a forest fire in April was a native of Nicholas County. Their deaths came after Nicholas County Sheriff’s Deputy Tom Baker was shot and killed in the line of duty in the summer of 2022.

“Our little county has had its share of tragedy,” said Davis.'",climate,heatwave

Juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish pictured with coral. Credit: Monique Webb, Byrne et al

Research conducted by marine biologists from the University of Sydney has found juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish can withstand tremendous heat waves well above levels that kill coral. These starfish then develop into carnivorous predators that devour reefs just as they begin to regrow.

Crown-of-thorns starfish are native to the Great Barrier Reef and found in the Indo-Pacific region, but they are classified as a species of concern because the damage large populations cause to coral is more significant than any other species. They fall behind only cyclones and bleaching events in their impact on coral mortality.

New findings suggest the species' resilience to warming waters could exacerbate the ravaging effect climate change has on coral reefs.

The research is published in the journal Global Change Biology, led by Professor Maria Byrne from the School of Life and Environmental Sciences. She is also a member of the Marine Science Institute and Sydney Environment Institute.

Over the course of the experiment, juvenile crown-of-thorns displayed a surprisingly high heat tolerance, higher than that observed in their adult counterparts. This means that even if the coral-eating adult stage declines in climate change-driven ocean warming scenarios, perhaps from a lack of their coral prey or from the heat, their herbivorous young can wait patiently for the opportune moment to grow into carnivores. Life cycle of coral with crown-of-thorns starfish. Beginning with healthy coral, heat wave events induce coral bleaching, causing coral death and algal colonization. Corals then collapse and create rubble habitat for juvenile crown-of-thorns, which can tolerate the thermal stress and build up in numbers until the reef regrows and the juveniles emerge to eat the new coral. Credit: University of Sydney, Byrne et al.

Coral bleaching and death can be triggered when waters warm by 1-3 degrees Celsius above the normal summer maximum, depending on how long the temperature lasts.

""We found juvenile crown of thorns starfish can tolerate almost three times the heat intensity that causes coral bleaching, using a model that measures temperature over time,"" Professor Byrne said.

""This is an important finding that has implications for understanding the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems, especially the influence of understudied small cryptic species. Juveniles might well benefit from warming waters. The increase in the amount of their rubble habitat, generated by coral bleaching and mortality, allows their numbers to build over time.""

The crown-of-thorns starfish is nature's ultimate coral predator, with a circle of life perfectly adapted to warming waters.

During outbreaks of their carnivorous adult phase, crown-of-thorns starfish dine pervasively on stony coral, leaving lifeless skeletons across the reef. These skeletons eventually become home to algae before crumbling. Bleaching induced coral mortality has a similar effect.

The remains of dead coral may provide the perfect habitat for the starfish's tiny, algae-eating offspring. According to previous research by Professor Byrne, the juveniles can survive, and wait, for at least six years for the reef to come back to life, and given the opportunity as coral recovers these juveniles can grow into coral-eating predators and start the cycle again.

""The heat resistance and potential for the juveniles to gradually buildup in the reef infrastructure in coral rubble over years might be a phenomenon contributing to the initiation of adult crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks,"" said Matt Clements, Ph.D. student and co-author of the study.

""Loss of natural predators due to overfishing and the buildup of nutrients in the water have been suspected to contribute to outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish. Now we have evidence that bleaching induced coral mortality could aid the sea floor-dwelling juveniles, leading to subsequent large waves of adults in reefs which exacerbate the ravages of climate change.""

The researchers also identified factors that contribute to the juveniles' ability to survive in warming conditions. They include small size, which may reduce physiological requirements, and their ability to feed on a variety of food sources, despite preferring a diet of coralline algae.

"'Watering your lawn in Wildwood when it’s not your day, time could get your water cut off

The city of Wildwood says it will cutoff water service to any property that remains in violation after a warning notice or citation.

WILDWOOD, FL (352today.com) – The city of Wildwood is cracking down on homeowners who are watering their lawns when they’re not supposed to be.

The city announced on Monday that it’s stepping up enforcement of irrigation restrictions in order to conserve water.

The Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) has been in phase I water shortage restrictions since November 21.

“The declaration prohibits ‘wasteful and unnecessary’ water use and requires the city of Wildwood to report on violations and enforcement actions related to conservation measures,” said the city in a news release.

The conservation measures limit days and times for irrigation.

The city says it will cutoff water service to any property that remains in violation after a warning notice or citation.

“We take these conservation practices seriously and recognize the role each and every resident plays in protecting what is arguably our most essential natural resource,” said Assistant Utility Director Jason Martin. “It is never our goal to interrupt service, but we are prepared to take such severe action when situations warrant, resulting at the very least in significant inconvenience and reconnection charges for repeat violators.”

When can you water your lawn?

In Sumter County, including the entire city of Wildwood, lawn watering is restricted to no more than twice per week and designates specific days and times that you’re allowed to water.

Properties having street addresses with even numbers (ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8) may water on Thursday and/or Sunday before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.

Addresses with odd numbers (ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) may water on Wednesday and/or Saturday before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.

Locations without an assigned address may water on Tuesday and/or Friday before 10 a.m. or after 4 p.m.

There are exceptions for new sod and landscaping. You can read those here.

The district says restrictions remain in effect through July 1, 2024, unless otherwise announced.

The Aces have torched the competition over the past two seasons. Sunday, the two-time WNBA champs are lighting the fire (in LED form) at Allegiant Stadium.

The Aces will light the Al Davis Memorial Torch prior to the Raiders-Vikings game. Kickoff is 1:05 p.m., so get there an hour or so early to catch the pre-game hype.

Mark Davis owns both franchises. And also the torch.

With 20 percent of its home games scheduled in the next eight days, the Raiders are accelerating their in-game halftime plans for the rest of the season.

Sunday, Phillpa Soo, who originated the role of Eliza Hamilton in “Hamilton” on Broadway, sings the national anthem. The Julliard-trained singer has won two Grammy Awards and been nominated for a Tony Award and Primetime Emmy Award.

The team is welcoming back Rachel Platten, singing “Stand By You” at halftime with David Perrico and the Raiders House Band. Platten sang “Fight Song” in pregame of the Raiders-Texans game, as part of the NFL’s initiative to fight cancer.

And the team is honoring pass-rush specialist Maxx Crosby as its nominee for the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, The honor is bestowed annually to an NFL player for excellence on the field and his impact within the community.

"'At the end of the regular season, Division I HBCU football teams have four options: go home, play in the SWAC championship, play in the FCS playoffs or play in the Celebration Bowl. The latter of said options is the best option for HBCUs, but HBCU fans and general football fanatics continue to root for HBCU football's best teams to play in the playoffs over the Celebration Bowl. Here are three reasons why that line of thinking is ridiculous for anyone rooting for the best interests of the best teams in HBCU football.

The payout is worth it.

Money isn't always the answer, but in the case of the best HBCUs playing in the Celebration Bowl, it's one of the answers to why fans should root for it.

The Celebration Bowl pays out $2 million — $1 million to the MEAC and SWAC — regardless of which team wins or loses. Meanwhile, to play in the FCS playoffs, HBCUs would have to either bid for a home game, paying a sum of money to host the game, or pick up the travel costs to play road games. For HBCUs primarily located in the South or on the East Coast, that could mean a potential chartered flight to the northwest to play a Big Sky or Missouri Valley Football Conference school after advancing beyond the regionalization of the first and second round.

Why would anyone root to pay costs of a road football game over a guaranteed payout from a football game, especially given the historical underfunding of HBCUs? It doesn't make sense.

Community support is guaranteed.

The Celebration Bowl has developed into an all-encompassing event for HBCUs, even extending beyond HBCUs into the larger Black culture sphere. The Celebration Bowl is known for its football game, but off the field, the game puts on numerous events in the community. That's proven as attendance numbers have grown in each of the last four Celebration Bowls.

Meanwhile, if the best HBCU teams didn't play in the Celebration Bowl, the community impact of a postseason game could fall entirely on the school itself rather than having the known assistance of an external institution/organization. While self-reliance is important, fans should root for the best HBCU team each year to play where it receives the most support?

The team can become the one true champion in HBCU football.

The best HBCU team could play in the FCS playoffs and try to compete to be the best team in the FCS. Or, it can compete in the Celebration Bowl to arguably become the best team in HBCU football.

The former option sounds enticing when taken for face value. Who wouldn't want to be the best team in an entire division of football? Yet, considering the historical records of HBCUs in the FCS playoffs — 6-31 and 0-20 records for MEAC and SWAC schools, respectively — being the best team in the FCS looks like a reach.

In contrast, the Celebration Bowl creates an opportunity for MEAC and SWAC schools to earn a claim as the best HBCU football program. When the MEAC and SWAC champions play on the field, it helps narrow debate for a Black College Football National Champion that would exist if the two champions didn't play each other because they played in the playoffs instead.

There will always be the potential for a case like 2021 Florida A&M or non-HBCU conference teams like North Carolina A&T University, Tennessee State University or Hampton University claiming the title of Black College Football National Champion. Yet, sending the best HBCU teams to the Celebration Bowl still narrows potential doubts of the credibility of one true champion, which is better for teams, players and fans in the long run.'",sports,football

Watch NFL football live with a digital HDTV antenna

Amazon

If you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.

Anyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).

This amplified digital antenna can receive hundreds of HD TV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, FOX, Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It received signals 360 degrees and delivers a high-quality picture in 4K, UHD and 1080 HDTV, top-tier sound and features a 16-foot digital coax cable. This Amazon best selling antenna is usually sells for about $23, though we've seen it priced as low as $16.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

Taylor Swift's NFL era: As the end of the 2023 NFL regular season nears, it's clear the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season was Taylor Swift (Travie Kelce, too). Swift's appearances at NFL stadiums including Lambeau, Gillette and Arrowhead sent Swifties of all ages into a frenzy that nearly overwhelmed the league itself. Football purists found the intrusion and Swift-related attention unnerving, but the pop sensation brought millions of new fans to the game. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be going strong, which means fans can expect to see Taylor herself in the stands of Kansas City Chiefs games as her schedule allows. Football fans may find it slightly annoying. But if the attention (and new audience) Taylor brought to professional NFL football just by showing up wasn't proof enough, it's Taylor's world and we're all just living in it -- one era at a time.

Is this the Cowboys year? Being a Dallas Cowboys fan requires a Texas-sized emotional commitment. Last season, fans gutted through quarterback Dak Prescott's winning record (not in a good way) of most interceptions thrown in the 2022-2023 season. Dak whittled his interceptions down this season and the Cowboys managed the unthinkable -- they toppled the mighty Philadelphia Eagles from their perch atop the NFC East in Week 14. But the Cowboys' 31-10 upset loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15 is the kind of play that makes Cowboys fans weary. The Cowboys could go all the way to the Super Bowl this season, but it won't be without taking Cowboys fans on an emotional rollercoaster best left at an amusement park.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different. Lamar is poised to have the best seasons of his career. MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already making a case to turn those MVP chants into reality. If you don't mind being called a ""bandwagon"" by the teenager in your life, there's never been a better time to jump on the Ravens bandwagon. We won't tell and neither should you.'",sports,football
"'Hospitality company Method Co., in collaboration with Detroit-based real estate developer Bedrock, has unveiled the first phase of dining and bar experiences at Detroit’s historic Book Tower after seven years of restoration.

At the heart of the transformation are three F&B venues: Le Suprême, a classic French brasserie; Kamper’s, a rooftop bar and lounge; and the soon-to-open Bar Rotunda, an all-day café and wine bar nestled beneath a glass atrium in the building’s lobby. These openings will be followed by several high-end Japanese concepts—including sake pub Sakazuki and izakaya and omakase option Hiroki San—coming this fall.

“Our team has fallen in love with Detroit and it has been an opportunity of a career to play a part in writing the story of Book Tower’s next 100 years,” says Randall Cook, CEO and cofounder of Method Co. “We have had the privilege to collaborate with Bedrock to conceptualize and bring to life eight different hospitality offerings within one of America’s most iconic properties.”

Le Suprême—crafted by Method Co.’s in-house design and branding firm, Method Studios, and Stokes Architecture + Design—spans 6,200 square feet with a café, bar, dining room, and outdoor seating along Washington Boulevard. With room for up to 210 guests, the space boasts a traditional La Bastille zinc bar top, art nouveau European tiles, hand-clipped mosaic marble flooring, oxblood leather booths, along with locally sourced vintage artwork, lamps, and furniture that pay homage to Detroit’s rich musical and cultural heritage.

Named in honor of Book Tower’s original architect, Louis Kamper, Kamper’s launches as Detroit’s latest upscale rooftop bar, designed in partnership with New York firm ODA Architecture. Located on the building’s 14th floor, Kamper’s includes an indoor lounge adorned with wood accents, mosaic flooring, antiqued mirrors, velvet drapery, and a distinguished paneled millwork bar. French doors open out to a rooftop area that offers sweeping views of the city.

Early next month, Book Tower will introduce Bar Rotunda, a 70-seat all-day café, cocktail, and wine bar inspired by the grand cafés and hotel bars of early 20th-century Paris. This space is graced by a carefully restored 100-year-old art glass dome, adorned with over 7,000 individual jewels and 6,000 glass panels. Also designed by Method Studios and ODA, the bar features a cristallo quartzite and tambour wood bar, restored Botticino marble columns, travertine floors, custom clawfoot library tables, and preserved bronze and brass detailing throughout.

“We have been ever-mindful of what the restoration of Book Tower means to this city,” Cook adds. “We’ve worked hard to create hospitality concepts that will excite and reconnect Detroiters to Book Tower once again, and at the same time honor the heritage of this magnificent property.”

In short, it should be a celebratory Sunday for women’s hoops, where we’ll gain insight into the future of the WNBA before enjoying some excellent NCAA action.

The Fever have the best odds of landing the No. 1 pick for a second-straight season, as they own 442 of the 1,000 chances. Next is the Mercury with 276-in-1,000 odds, followed by the Sparks with 178-in-1,000 odds. The Storm round out the lottery with 104 of the 1,000 chances. As recently as 2022, the Washington Mystics, owners of the third-best odds, were awarded the No. 1 pick. In the era of four lottery teams, the only time a franchise with the fourth-best odds received the No. 1 pick was in 2012, when the Sparks won the right to select Nneka Ogumike.

Between now and Dec. 10, Fever, Mercury, Sparks and Storm fans can dream of the likes of Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, Rickea Jackson, Paige Bueckers or Angel Reese suiting up for their squad by spinning Across the Timeline’s draft lottery simulator.

WNBA’s Portland plans paused

Almost as soon as the WNBA confirmed expansion to the Bay Area with WNBA Golden State, several reports indicated that Portland would be announced as the second expansion city shortly thereafter. Instead, last Wednesday, The Oregonian’s Bill Oram revealed Portland’s expansion bid, led by local millionaire Kirk Brown and supported by Senator Ron Wyden, had fallen through. According to Oram, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert sent a letter to Wyden detailing the league’s decision to defer expansion due to expected renovations to the Moda Center, home of the NBA’s Trail Blazers and the hoped-for home of a WNBA team, in the coming summers. Oram reported that sources close to Blazers’ owner Jody Allen contested Engelbert’s rationale for deferral, suggesting the franchise did not plan to begin arena renovations until 2027, giving the WNBA team, which would debut in the summer of 2025, two seasons in the Moda Center before having to relocate for one season in the summer of 2027.

BREAKING: Plans to bring a WNBA team to Portland have fallen through, sources say, and it is unclear whether millionaire entrepreneur Kirk Brown remains involved with the city's bid. https://t.co/iuOvsOPttJ — Bill Oram (@billoram) November 1, 2023

Subsequent reporting from Howard Megdal at The Next further muddles the WNBA’s decision, as a league source told Megdal “the renovation issue was common knowledge back in the spring of 2023,” when the league “moved forward with this bid anyway.”

Interesting reporting via @howardmegdal:



“But the plans to renovate Moda Center had been public for some time, in general terms, …that the renovation issue was common knowledge back in the spring of 2023. The league moved forward with this bid anyway.” https://t.co/53CBzjzc4E — Jackie Powell (she/her) (@ClassicJpow) November 2, 2023

Considering facilities were cited as the main reason that Denver and Toronto fell short as WNBA expansion cities, it is not surprising that an arena issue has scuttled the league’s plan to expand to Portland, at least for now. However, the lack of clarity about the renovations to the Moda Center—both when they will occur and when WNBA leadership learned when they will occur—raises questions about the process behind the league’s evaluation of Portland’s expansion bid.

WNBA x Kim K.

In her tenure as WNBA Commissioner, Cathy Engelbert has prioritized expanding the league’s sponsorship portfolio. Well, she’s kashing in again, as the WNBA, along with the NBA, is partnering with Skims, the underwear brand founded by Kim Kardashian.

Of the partnership, Engelbert said:

The athletes of the WNBA are trendsetters and cultural influencers. There is no better time to be joining the league as a partner, and we are excited to work with SKIMS, a brand that has quickly cemented its status as a cultural centerpiece, to elevate each other’s brands and celebrate female athletes and their impact in society.

Team USA 3x3 punches ticket to Paris

On Nov. 1, the United States’ 3x3 Women’s National Team qualified for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. A second-place finish in FIBA’s 3x3 Federation Ranking earned Team USA the trip to Paris, exempting them from the forthcoming Olympic Qualifying Tournament.

Surviving, and thriving, during a summer full of competitions resulted in Team USA securing the opportunity to defend the gold medal won by Allisha Gray, Jackie Young, Kelsey Plum and Stefanie Dolson in 2021. The events that various iterations of Team USA competed in to qualify for the 2024 Games included: 3x3 AmeriCup, FIBA 3x3 Women’s Series, senior/U23/U18 World Cups, U23/U21 Nations Leagues, and the Pan American Games.

While a gold medal victory at the Pan Am Games by Lexie Hull, Azurà Stevens, Cierra Burdick and Blake Dietrick and a World Cup title won by Burdick, Linnae Harper, Hailey Van Lith and Cameron Brink were some of Team USA’s high points, a number of athletes will deserve credit when Team USA 3x3 is, hopefully, atop the medal stand in Paris next summer. Jennifer Rizzotti, president of the Connecticut Sun and chair of the Women’s National Team Committee, praised the sacrifices made by the players who suited up for Team USA:

There are some athletes we asked to play eight to 10 different events for us that ended up with the highest number of points. There were some athletes we asked to play four or five events, but they were college kids that were dealing with summer school and in some cases the start of the fall semester.

Rizzotti added, “It’s been a lot of tough tournaments, travel and less-than-ideal scenarios to have to play basketball in. You just have a real appreciation for the process and the people that you go through with.”

"'BRYAN, Texas (KBTX) - Though still prominent across the Brazos Valley, Extreme Drought (level 3/4) is receding to the west!

A few rounds of repetitive showers have brought the eastern portions of the region more rain the rest. This is especially evident in Montgomery and San Jacinto Counties, where areas are technically rid of drought all together, now just dealing with abnormally dry conditions. However, those areas are in the minority.

We have still got a long way to go in order to see this type of improvement become widespread across Southeast Texas. With that being said, October is typically the wettest month of the year, and there are quite a few rain chances on the back half of the extended forecast, so the potential for relief is in sight!

Across the state, this week’s monitor does not look all that different from last week’s. The worst of the drought still resides in the central and eastern portions of the state, while the panhandle remains in better shape than most.

We've seen some improvement across the Brazos Valley and state thanks to a couple different rounds of widespread rain through the first half of October. (KBTX)

With improving drought conditions, it is also interesting to note that 15 of the 16 counties across the Brazos Valley have lifted their burn bans. The only county with an active burn ban as of October 19th, is Brazos County.

"'A father and his 6-year-old daughter were fishing on Lake Michigan. Then they stumbled upon a century-old shipwreck

Six year old Henley Wolak is used to finding the big one while out on the water with dad. I like fishing with my daddy. The find one day this summer near Green Island was unlike any the duo had discovered before. Well, I was surprised that I had never seen it before because it's in an area where people regularly go based off the boat's side imaging. Henley had her own idea what they might have found. Ah, it's Lon 10. It told me the mars all that would have been something. Dad Tim Wolak thought it was *** shipwreck but hadn't heard of one being in that location before. He took his pictures to Facebook groups where someone with the Wisconsin Historical Society came across them. We went back to our database to see if there was anything reported in the area and we didn't have anything. However, in the database, we have information on historic losses and this fits the lost location of um the George L Newman, the 122 ft long George L Newman carrying lumber from Little Sumako was trying to navigate thick black smoke on the night of the Peshtigo fire when it grounded near Green Island, the crew was rescued and stayed on the island for *** week trying to salvage what they could from the vessel. It was actually built in 1855. So it's *** pretty significant shipwreck, um, pretty old old for, for Wisconsin shipwrecks anyway. And to have it tied to the Peshtigo fire is, it makes it even more special. *** few shipwrecks are reported to the historical society each year but one from *** six year old and her dad is rare. I don't know how we top it. I told her, I'm pretty sure there's no one else in her school that's ever found ***, *** shipwreck that nobody had recorded before.

When Tim Wollak’s 6-year-old daughter first saw something unusual while fishing in Lake Michigan, she thought it was an octopus.But the unusual item they detected off Wisconsin’s Green Island over the summer turned out to be something much more rare: The never-before-seen wreck of a ship that sunk in 1871.Wollak and his daughter Henley, who live in Peshtigo, Wisconsin, often spend time together fishing, according to CNN affiliate WLUK. Henley told WLUK she likes to collect rocks and sea glass while her father fishes.The pair were “just kind of driving around” he told WLUK. “And there was.”And while Henley immediately thought the strange sight was a “rare” Green Bay Octopus, her father realized it appeared to be a shipwreck.“I was surprised I had never seen it before because it’s in an area where people regularly go,” said Wollak, according to WLUK.After spotting the wreck, Wollak started researching to see if he could identify the ship. None had previously been marked in that area, according to a Facebook post from the Wisconsin Historical Society.Eventually, he got in contact with the historical society’s Maritime Preservation and Archaeology Program to help further his research, the Facebook post says.On Dec. 4, crews working with Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Conservation Warden Mike Neal used a remote-operated vehicle to investigate the shipwreck.They were able to see a wooden three-masted sailing ship, about 8 to 10 feet deep in the water, according to the society.While officials haven’t been able to identify the ship yet, the location and available data match that of the barkentine George L. Newman, the society said.This ship was built in Ohio in 1855 and was 122 feet long.The society said the vessel wrecked on Oct. 8, 1871, while sailing through heavy smoke from the Great Peshtigo Fire – the deadliest forest fire in U.S. history. A lighthouse keeper rescued the crew, and they stayed at the lighthouse for a week while salvaging what they could from the shipwreck.The vessel was “abandoned, became covered with sand, and was largely forgotten” until the Wollaks spotted it, the society said.Wollak told WLUK he’s not sure how his future fishing trips with his daughter will compare to their exciting discovery.“I don’t know how we top it,” said Tim Wollak. “I told her I’m pretty sure there’s no one else in her school that has ever found a shipwreck that nobody had recorded before….I guess we’ll just have to fish more and see if we can find more shipwrecks.”In the spring, the Wisconsin Historical Society will survey the wreck and assess it for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.The Wollaks’ discovery comes just a few months after another long-lost shipwreck was spotted in Lake Michigan. The schooner Trinidad, built in 1867 and wrecked in 1881, was discovered earlier this year, the Historical Society announced in September.'",climate,heatwave
"'Slash Lane, near Loughborough, was one of a number of roads in Leicestershire closed by flooding

A series of flood warnings are in place in and around the East Midlands.

There are warnings - meaning flooding is expected - along several rivers including at caravan parks on the River Trent at Tolney Lane Caravan Park and River Soar near Barrow.

The Environment Agency said some river levels were rising because of recent rainfall and the weekend's melting snow.

Councils are warning drivers not to ignore road closure signs.

High river levels are threatening some nearby properties, like these at Radcliffe on Trent, Nottinghamshire

On Thursday, Nottinghamshire County Council closed the A617 in Newark between the Cattle Market Roundabout and Fox Inn.

It also reminded motorists not to drive through flood water, as it is often not obvious how deep flood water is, and warned other hazards like potholes can be hidden beneath.

In and around Nottinghamshire, flood warnings are in place for the River Maun at Haughton, Milton and West Drayton and the Soar at Zouch Island.

There are also warnings for the River Trent at Carlton on Trent, including Beck Cottage, at Cavendish Bridge and at Collingham and Girton.

Analysis

By Sara Blizzard, BBC East Midlands Today weather presenter

The weather will be staying unsettled over the weekend so more rain is forecast.

Today will be showery but tomorrow we can expect a band of heavy rain to move in during the morning across Leicestershire and Rutland, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. This will clear during the morning to leave heavy blustery showers by the afternoon once the rain has departed. Sunday will also see heavy showers or more prolonged periods of rain and strong winds.

Although showery at the start of next week, there are signs that the weather might become more settled again from midweek.

In Leicestershire, there is a flood warning on the River Soar at caravan parks near Barrow upon Soar and in Derbyshire for the River Amber at Ambergate.

Around 17 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, are in place for the East Midlands and surrounding areas, including the River Erewash, River Idle, River Leen, Day Brook and Tottle Brook, River Maun and River Meden.

A yellow weather warning for rain was lifted on Thursday.

Nottingham City Transport said its South Notts 1 service was diverting via Hoton and Cotes (A60 and A6006) due to flooding in Stanford-on-Soar.

But it added its Pathfinder 26 and Sky Blue 46, 47 services were back to their full routes after flooding disruption on Thursday.

Traffic service Inrix is reporting a number of road closures due to flooding in Leicestershire.

These are in Meadow Lane in Loughborough, Rearsby Road in Rearsby, Sileby Road in Mountsorrel and Syston Road in Cossington.

“The Sunday Morning Bray”, by Bray! These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

John 16:33 (King James Version) The latest version of the Forestry Management Plan is a complete disaster for the forests due to it either ignoring or negligently ignoring the two main reasons for the plan to exist. The plan completely ignores the fact the Spotted Owl is becoming extinct due to predators rather than Old Growth Forest reductions and it has no mention of forest fires in any of its modeling which is the main reason the forests are being destroyed. It appears the plan was designed by politicians who wanted to gain favor from their friends and family by worshiping the forests rather than managing them. It fails to mention the Spotted Owl is being hunted and killed by the Barred Owl which migrated from the Midwest to the West Coast and is a very aggressive predator which is killing the Spotted owl to gain territory and a food source. The Forest Service has proposed to hire Barred Owl bounty hunters to shoot the ballooning numbers of Barred owls to protect the Spotted Owl. The Federal Forest Service wants to kill over 500,000 Barred Owls in an attempt to save their beloved Spotted Owl. Not only is the Forest Service trying to pick and choose species in the forest they are attempting an impossible tactic to hunt these owls in the forests against impossible odds. Who are they going to hire to do their dirty work, out of work loggers who were put out of work by the fake Spotted Owl studies? How are these hunters going to be able to hunt a bird which has the perfect camouflage method in the middle of the forests at night? The same people who want to kick the loggers and hunters out of the forests are going to try to train hunters to hunt a small night owl in a tangle of trees. There is no possible way they can make a significant difference in the deaths of Spotted Owls using this hope and prayer bounty program. The Spotted Owl is being hunted into extinction by a predator and no matter how much anyone wishes it will not happen these owls are going to continue to be hunted for territorial and feeding reasons. This is exactly what Darwin’s theory explained about survival of the fittest. The logger has no effect on whether these owls live or die although he plan pretends the logger is the sole reason of their extinction and being punished the most.

The second mistake in the plan is the complete dismissal of massive forest fires spreading across Oregon forests.

These forests are being destroyed by the Forest Service by not properly managing them. Rather than thinning, harvesting, and rotating forests as been done in the past this plan calls for the continued killing of the forests by mismanaging them to the point of being overgrown thickets waiting for a spark to turn into a massive furnace scorching everything in its path. The tree worshipers believe chainsaw bad, forest fires good and is the way they think over the past forty years. They would rather have a 500 square mile forest fire than to have a single tree cut down by a chainsaw. It sounds virtuous if you do not care about results but is just the opposite of how you take care of a forest. If you care about clean air and water then you need to make the forests as healthy as possible to produce the most oxygen and water filtering/water holding roots possible. Any other outcome is a failure. A medium to large forest fire will produce more CO2 and actual pollutants than a years’ worth of car emissions in Oregon, Washington, and California. You would think the Forest plan would call for the properly managed forests with young vibrant trees resistant to fire and producing as much oxygen as possible, but this plan does just the opposite and is a death sentence to the forests. This plan ignores these two facts and blames every forest issue on the Climate Change umbrella. The assumed draught will cause all sorts of catastrophes and is being used as an excuse to close the forests down to protect them when it will do just the opposite. The past two years have been fire free due to the fact these have been the wettest and coldest years on the West Coast in the past twenty years. They were the shortest summers with only a couple days over a hundred and snowpacks over 50 feet all the way down to California closing down ski resorts due to too much snow which came early and left late. Without addressing the Spotted Owl inevitability or the forest fire destruction of the Oregon resources this plan is not worth the paper it is written on. Unfortunately, the implementation of this program will cost the state billions if not trillions of dollars in lost revenue and dead trees as well as poorer quality air and water. This plan is definition of penny wise and pound foolish. This is exactly what happens when you worship the trees rather than managing them properly. This is what happens when man creates a religion which worships God’s creation rather than the Creator of the universe. This is the problem with forty years of the DNC in firm control of your forests and state. They have lied about the Spotted Owl from the beginning and have now been exposed so they are doing whatever they can to keep the lie alive by massacring another owl to protect their politically weaponized owl. Pray for Oregon Note: The above opinion is not necessarily my own, but FReeper Bray’s. If you wish to discuss this, please ping Bray.

Spotted Owl Fricassee

Ingredients

• 2 whole plucked and washed Spotted Owls

• 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste

• 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

• 2 cups thickly sliced fresh mushrooms

• 1 cup diced yellow onion

• ½ cup sliced shallots (Optional)

• 2 cloves garlic, minced

• ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

• 1 pinch cayenne

• 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour

• 1 ½ cups white wine

• 6 sprigs thyme

• 1 cup chicken broth

• ½ cup heavy cream

Directions

1. Season the owls with salt on both sides.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and place Spotted Owls skin-side-down into the hot oil. Cook until there is a good sear and fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until seared as well, about 2 minutes. Set aside.

3. Leave 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the pan and add sliced mushrooms. Cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add onion, shallots, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper and cayenne and stir in flour to thicken the mixture, about 1 minute.

4. Pour in white wine and cook, stirring, until alcohol has evaporated. Raise the heat to high and keep cooking until sauce has reduced to half, 3 to 5 minutes.

5. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-lo and add chicken and any accumulated juices back into the skillet, skin side up. Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes, turning over thighs halfway through.

6. Remove lid and turn thighs back to skin side up. Continue to simmer uncovered, basting occasionally, until chicken is tender and sauce reduces even more. If the pan gets dry before the chicken is tender, add some more water or broth.

7. Add cream and simmer until sauce reaches desired thickness. Heat can be raised to medium to reduce cream faster if the owls ares already tender. Sauce can be served thin and runny, or reduced to a thick sauce. Sprinkle with fresh thyme and serve.

Excellent piece your liberal govt. at work. When something does not work employ more of what didn't work in the beginning: Namely more BIG GOVERNMENT!! ........................ Here in the Keys/entire state of Florida, we have a similar problem. We have a fish called the Jewfish(aka Goliath Grouper). see photo: About 15 years ago idiot spearfishermen took advantage of this lethargic fish and began spearing it to extinction. The obvious solution was to eliminate spearguns on this and maybe a few other fish as long as necessary.A zero bag limit could have been employed for a while until the species recovered which might have taken a few years maybe five or more. Instead the powers that be went hog/govt. reg. wild and closed off Jewfish(the name at the time) basically until a few liberal journalists decided it was time to allow some form of harvest.(still to be decided today almost 20 years later.) What happened now that the jewfish was totally protected is that it quickly became an apex predator.Not many and few creatures could harm the jewfish which was a great idea for a few years as it recovered its numbers. Today the jewfish/Goliath Grouper is a true apex predator. It preys on everything on Gulfside wrecks in the gulf of Mexico (GOM)and now is a huge player on the Atlantic side of the keys and heading north on both sides of Florida. On GOM wrecks juvenile grouper which are bag and size limit protected from fishing are constant targets as are juvenile crawfish which are also bag and size limit protected and time of year from fishermen.That works. Nowadays Jewfish eat them at will. Perhaps the worst problem is almost any fish hooked by fishermen can expect to be eaten by the Jewfish. It's out of control and as long as the crazed environmentals are in control will stay that way. Today the jewfish is protected at the expense of dozens of other species: It's the big government way. If that wasn't bad enough enter an expanding near shore shark population. It's bad enough fishermen have to try and find places where there are no or few jewfish. Over the past few years shark populations have expanded so bad that most gamefish are now in desperate situations not seen in the past. Historically, sportfishermen like myself have paid much homage to periodicals like the Florida Sportman magazine and others like it. This magazine in particular had become a bible for sportfishermen who over the years became much more CPR inclined than catch and kill. CPR in fishermens lingo stands for: Catch- Photograph- and Release. We have learned how to take great photos of gamefish like snook, tarpon,bonefish, permit, sailfish,etc. so we can protect their numbers for anglers in the future. Basically, we all wanted our sons and daughters to enjoy what we enjoy or used to now on the water. Modern sport fishermen are the conservationists of the 21st century and we come down hard on those who dare kill our gamefish. It's just good common sense. We still hate liberals!! So what has happened for the past few years is that near shore shark populations have expanded to the point where if we can escape the ravages of jewfish at one fishing spot we usually can't escape the sharks at another. In many spots both in Florida Bay and offshore gamefish like those reported along with snappers and other fish sharks eat them when hooked them or after being released in good shape. I have interviewed over 1,000 fishermen and have found the problem is now state wide and little if anything is being done to solve it. These fish,tarpon in particular,can live 70 years if treated properly by fishermen. Here in the photo below a fly fisherman releases one in good shape: Shark infestation is taking a huge toll on tarpon and other valued gamefish: We need a legislative push to kill off near shore sharks and sell them for food or worst case give their meat away to those in need. that's what we would like to see,however many fishermen likely wont stand for the slaughter of prized gamefish we have worked so hard to save for decades. The problem will be solved. Likely not by govt. Over the next few years since many of us won't allow govt. in-action to drive us out of business. Or, in many cases,depriving us of what we work for all week. Shark populations have to decline. Our goals are: to go fishing,catch gamefish and release them in good shape. No one will stop us from doing that. Big liberal govt. never works.

Obiden had to do something. Inaction was effecting his numbers so he sunk a few Houti speed boats. Biden now in the islands where a sailboat was seen flying an FU flag for Biden. He's hated everywhere by everyone. Cory Mills of Fla. saying Biden can't win. Lying Jared Bernstein who can turn any stats into looking good for the libs now on with Mike Emmanuel. Bernstein is head of council of economic advisers. He's gonna say how well everything is and how wonderful it will be with the dirty dems in office. Bernstein says the problems will be solved by lowering costs,what a putz! Problem is 20,000 illegals coming across the border 7% interest and all the rest that Bernstein will never talk about. Bernstein says we have continual budget deficit reduction,can you lie any better than that? What a lying POS he has an excuse for everything. ....................... Next the panel with Mariel Hemingway and three libs. Julia Manchester from the hill says biden is vulnerable,duhhhh...... no sh-t sherlock. Now juannnnn Williams who says O'biden is headed in the right direction and hes right out the door. LOL!! Mariel Hemingway points out the grocery store,bying a house etc etc.are impossible.

Communists have found a club to beat capitalists using the endangered species act. The could not care less about the species and everything about closing down freedom. The Spotted owl would not be endangered if the forests were managed properly rather than shut down. They have found larger numbers in second growth forests than old growth but they still promote the myth of old growth only.

tOSU hired a novice to be head coach at suggestiuon/demand of Urban Meyer. Ryan Day had never been a head coach. He came from a Division 1-A school (U of New Hampshire), played QB. His incompetence has always been obvious. Jim Harbaugh deemed him “born on third base and thought he’d hit a triple”. Lou Holtz (a former OSU assistant when they won National Title under Woody, called Day’s teams “Soft”. Big Uproar. But the fact is Day is a Beta male, stubborn, insists on calling plays (that do not work), will not replace bad coaches, and can’t even cajole his players to PLAY in Bowl games which are not for all the marbles. He recruits one-and-done types who have no loyalty to Ohio or tOSU except for how much NIL money they can glean. I hope that partially outlines the problem/issue. GO BUCKS! And Roll Tide! (whose coach Nick Saban learned smash-mouth football under Woody’s heir Earle Bruce at tOSU)

"'Saudi's super sports city is back. It's called Qiddiya, a land 600,000 will call home and be able to easily walk between their hospital, school, water park and race track.

The Saudi Crown Prince has relaunched and “rebranded” his project outside of Riyadh called Qiddiya – a super-city purely focused on sports, leisure and entertainment. The new Qiddiya vision has been announced without a price tag, nor a firm opening date, but is described as a “cornerstone of Vision 2030” – Mohammed Bin Salman’s ambition to diversify his kingdom’s economy away from oil exports by the end of the decade.

When complete, the plan is for Qiddiya to create more than 325,000 jobs and add 135 billion Saudi Riyals ($36 billion) to the GDP each year it is up and running. It plans to have its own race track, a Six Flags theme park and FIFA World Cup-ready football stadiums, all spread over a space around twice the size of Washington D.C. (360 square kilometers).

Here are some of the facilities Qiddiya is promising:

43 sports facilities

12 theme parks

275 rides

15 hospitals

60,000 buildings

160,000 residences

600,000 residents

A gaming and e-sports district

The world’s largest Olympic museum

Qiddiya also expects 48 million visitors a year; 1.8 million of those will be visiting purely to watch football matches.

We don’t know how much all of this will add up to dollar-wise, but the Qiddiya Investment Company, which MBS chairs, has awarded contracts worth $2.7 billion so far. Qiddiya says its main waterpark is 61% built, the Six Flags is 59% complete, and all its golf courses have been “shaped” over land equal in size to 215 football fields.

Based on the original plans, Qiddiya is well behind schedule. The project was first unveiled back in 2018, with its first phase expected to be done by 2022 and the Six Flags park up and running by 2023.

It is very likely that Qiddiya will become a sports epicenter if Saudi hosts the FIFA World Cup 2034, which it is currently the only bidder for.

In terms of funding, Qiddiya has the safety net of the country’s sovereign wealth fund, called the Public Investment Fund, which has around $700 billion in assets. This same fund is pumping dollars into other mega projects in the kingdom, ranging from The Red Sea archipelago tourism site to skiing retreats.

Saudi Vision Delays

On Thursday, Saudi officials admitted for the first time that some flagship “Vision 2030” projects are facing delays, with some being pushed to 2033 or 2035.

Bloomberg reported that the Saudi government, which is forecasting budget deficits every year till 2026, has decided on delaying projects “to build capacity and avert huge inflationary pressures and supply bottlenecks,” Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said Thursday. He didn’t specify which projects would be affected.

All plans had been reviewed based on “economic, social, employment and quality-of-life returns among other factors over the last 18 months,” he said. As a result, some are “being accelerated and some — largely projects in the pipeline which have not been announced yet — are given a longer executional timeframe,” he added.

“There are strategies that have been postponed and there are strategies that will be financed after 2030,” Al Jadaan said.'",sports,soccer
"'Lars Ulrich broke the sad news that his father Torben Ulrich passed away at the age of 95. The Metallica drummer paid tribute to his dad on Instagram with a carousel of photos taken throughout his dad's long life.

""Torben Ulrich: 1928-2023,"" he wrote. ""95 years of adventures, unique experiences, curiosity, pushing boundaries, challenging the status quo, tennis, music, art, writing….and quite a bit of Danish contrarian attitude. Thank you endlessly! I love you dad""

The elder Ulrich became a legend to Metallica fans after his appearance in the band's Some Kind of Monster documentary, which followed the recording of 2003's St. Anger. When asked his opinion after hearing a song snippet in the studio, Torben famously said ""I would delete that.""

Torben, who was an artist himself (as well as a professional tennis player), liked to challenge his son and the band. “I think he appreciates Metallica, especially when we’re daring and a little unorthodox, when we play strange sideways tempos … He appreciates that side of it,” said Lars in a 2017 interview with SoundBox (via Consequence). “When we play a little straighter and a little safer he raises an eyebrow.”

"'Los Angeles won’t have to wait long to host another Super Bowl.

The NFL’s championship event will return to SoFi Stadium in February 2027 following the 2026 season. NFL owners voted Wednesday at the NFL Winter League Meeting in Dallas to approve the site.

“We are very excited to bring the Super Bowl back to Los Angeles for the second time in five years,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a press release. “The city did an outstanding job hosting Super Bowl 56 in the incredible SoFi Stadium and we believe that Super Bowl 61 will be even more memorable. The Los Angeles Rams, the Los Angeles Host Committee and many other outstanding partners will help create an unforgettable week of events culminating in Super Bowl Sunday in 2027 that will celebrate the region as an epicenter of sports, entertainment and culture.”

This will mark two Super Bowls played in Inglewood in a five-year span after the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl LVI on Feb. 13, 2022. Quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Rams in a fourth-quarter comeback, finding Cooper Kupp for a one-yard touchdown to take the lead with 1:25 to play before defensive tackle Aaron Donald made two defensive stops to complete the victory.

Kupp was named MVP of the game after catching eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns.

Super Bowl LVI marked the return of the big game to Southern California for the first time since 1993.

“After 29 years, Super Bowl LVI was an amazing event that delivered significant economic and community impact for the Los Angeles region,” said Kathryn Schloessman, President & CEO of the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission. “We’re thrilled to welcome back the NFL for Super Bowl LXI at SoFi Stadium in 2027 and look forward to building on the foundation we established, providing local diverse businesses the opportunity to compete for contracts, and using the spotlight to benefit the community organizations doing good work in our region.”

Now with two Super Bowls in five years, SoFi Stadium will be the first venue to host the event twice in such a short time span since Miami’s Dolphin Stadium (later Sun Life Stadium and now Hard Rock Stadium) hosted the game in 2007 and 2010.

Super Bowl LXI in 2027 will be the ninth time the game has been played in the greater Los Angeles area.

“We are grateful to Commissioner Goodell and our partners at the other 31 teams for this opportunity to once again elevate our league’s biggest moment,” Rams owner/chairman E. Stanley Kroenke said. “More so, we are honored that Super Bowl will return to Los Angeles and Inglewood for a second time in five years and excited to build upon the substantial impact to local businesses and community organizations that resulted from hosting Super Bowl LVI.”

The L.A. Memorial Coliseum has hosted twice – the first title game in 1967 and again in 1973 – and the Rose Bowl has held it five times (1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993).

Super Bowl LXI will mark 60 years since Super Bowl I.

“The Los Angeles region continues to attract world-renowned events and we look forward to yet again hosting the Super Bowl,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. “I want to thank Inglewood Mayor James Butts for his work on this effort and I look forward to locking arms to make this a success. I know our entire region looks forward to watching the Rams win the Super Bowl at home, again.”

With the Super Bowl comes many smaller events around the area, ranging from fan experiences to charity drives, and of course the halftime show, which was headlined by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre in 2022.

SoFi Stadium is now scheduled to host three premier events in a three-year span, the World Cup in 2026 and the Summer Olympics coming to Southern California in 2028.

“On behalf of the City of Inglewood, we are pleased to welcome the NFL and Super Bowl LXI back to Inglewood in 2027,” Butts said. “Given the success of the 2022 event, we are certain the NFL will find SoFi Stadium and the City of Inglewood ready to deliver an exciting and memorable Super Bowl LXI.”

This season’s Super Bowl will be held Feb. 11, 2024, at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans will host the Super Bowl in 2025, followed by Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara in 2026.'",sports,football

VENTURA, California (Reuters) - Beachfront California residents on Friday cleaned up from flood damage unleashed by massive waves that pounded the coastline a day earlier and braced for another bout of extreme surf and heavy showers forecast into the weekend.

The National Weather Service (NWS) posted high surf and coastal flood warnings for much of the California shoreline from San Diego north to the San Francisco Bay area, with breaking waves expected to reach 20, 25 and even 40 feet (12 m) in height in some areas.

The treacherous surf and coastal flood threat was attributed to a Pacific storm system also bringing heavy downpours to much of the West Coast on Friday night, while coinciding with the latest arrival of exceptionally high tides known as king tides.

""Significant flooding ... is likely over vulnerable, low-lying coastal areas around the time of high tide,"" the NWS warned. ""Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near shore.""

The seaside town of Ventura, about 65 miles (105 km)northwest of Los Angeles, got a taste of such hazards on Thursday, when heavy surf inundated homes and businesses with seawater, sand and ocean debris.

Video footage broadcast by NBC News showed powerful, rogue waves crashing over a seawall onto a beachfront street, knocking people down as others dashed to safety on Thursday in Ventura, where eight people were reported to have been injured.

The aftermath was visible on Friday at an ocean side hotel where ground-level porches stood cluttered with debris and shattered first-floor windows were covered over in plywood.

Nearby, workers spent the morning stacking sandbags to protect other low-lying properties from further damage.

""Well, the water came over the wall, and you probably saw from any of the videos that it washed down the street like it was a river,"" recalled Dan Roundtree, 63, who told Reuters his residential complex was flooded. ""So we're all trying to recoup from yesterday's water and prepare ourselves as best as possible for tomorrow.""

Even as residents girded for the next onslaught, a few avid surfers donned wetsuits to take advantage of the still high but less ferocious waves that prevailed on Friday, in the relative lull before what forecasters were predicting for Saturday.

Kenny Powell, 64, another Ventura resident and surfing enthusiast, said that while many surfers live for the thrill of riding exceptionally big waves, Thursday's conditions proved too challenging for him to venture into the swells.

""And we actually picked a few people out of the water,"" he said. ""Mother Nature had a little more than we had planned for.""

"'UConn women’s basketball star Azzi Fudd said she’s planning on returning to Storrs next season instead of entering the WNBA Draft. The standout junior guard told ESPN’s Rebecca Lobo that she’ll be back in a video posted to Lobo’s X account.

“I plan on staying,” Fudd said in the short video posted on Monday. “Why would I want to leave the basketball capital of the world?”

.@UConnWBB junior @azzi_35 is eligible for the 2024 @WNBA draft. What are her plans? She was definitive when I asked her. pic.twitter.com/6M5mMVTkyp — Rebecca Lobo (@RebeccaLobo) October 30, 2023

Fudd, who will be a senior during the 2024-25 season, is eligible to enter the WNBA Draft after this season and would likely be a top pick. The 5-11 guard is well-known as one of– if not the best– shooters in the country and has averaged 13.3 points, 2.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 1.1 steals in her two years so far at UConn. In 25 games last season, Fudd shot 43 percent from 3-point range and 45.7 percent overall.

She was named to the preseason All-Big East team ahead of this season, and named to the 20-player watch list for the Cheryl Miller Award, which goes to the nation’s top shooting guard.

Fudd has struggled with injuries during her time at UConn, as a foot injury saw her sidelined during her freshman year and she missed much of last season due to knee injuries. The 20-year-old has been breathtaking while on the court, however.

Fudd’s announcement leaves UConn fans wondering whether her backcourt mate Paige Bueckers will return as well.

Bueckers, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL, has two more years of eligibility remaining after this season but would likely be one of the top picks in the WNBA Draft if she decided to come out. (ESPN has her at No. 2 in its 2024 Mock Draft, behind Iowa guard Caitlin Clark). Bueckers is listed as a redshirt junior this year and has already taken three years of classes. She turned 22 in October and has yet to announce whether or not she will return to UConn next season.

“I’ve really learned in all that I’ve been through not to speak about the future because you never know what’s going to happen,” Bueckers said back in June. “So I’m just trying to stay present, stay in the moment but you never know. I have no idea.”'",sports,basketball
"'Improvements have been found across parts of Bexar County, the Hill Country, and I-35 corridor.

For the first time in two and a half months, Thursday morning’s (11/2) drought monitor shows improvements in and around the San Antonio area! We still have a long way to go, though, as we try to chip away at this prolonged drought.

KEY POINTS

It’s been over 780 days since all of South Central Texas was last considered drought-free.

We’ve fluctuated between the different classifications of drought within that timeframe, but a relatively dry summer sent the entirety of Bexar County back into exceptional drought (the worst category) in August.

With late October rains, however, the exceptional drought has now been erased from parts of Bexar County, the Hill Country, and the I-35 corridor.

Drought still remains in place across the majority of the area (just not as bad), meaning we still have a long way to go!

Sign up for the Whatever the Weather newsletter here. Email Address Sign up.

LATEST DROUGHT MONITOR (RELEASED 11/2)

While exceptional drought (shown below in maroon) had been in place across portions of the Hill Country for quite some time, a drier-than-average summer caused it to expand into Bexar County and much of the I-35 corridor in August.

That was still the theme around mid-October, but recent rains leading up to Halloween managed to bring some improvements just in time to kick off the month of November.

As of the latest update released on November 2, exceptional drought has been erased from parts of Bexar County, as well as the Hill Country and I-35 corridor. Extreme drought (level 3/4) now replaces that in most of these areas (shown below in red).

A pocket of exceptional drought is still noted in far western Bexar, eastern Medina and northern Atascosa counties.

Drought is still very much present (just not at the most intense level) across the majority of the area, so we still have a long way to go!

Here’s the comparison of the past two weeks for reference:

OCTOBER RAINFALL

While still technically drier than average, October did bring beneficial rainfall to the Alamo City.

Over 3.2 inches of rain fell throughout the month, with 1.76 inches noted in just the last week. This stretch of rain helped lead to these latest drought improvements!

The last week of October brought over 1.7 inches of rain to the Alamo City.

As mentioned above, we still have a long way to go in order to alleviate the existing drought still in place.

Only two months (October 2021 and April 2023) over the past two years were considered wetter than average. This lack of rainfall dug us into a deep hole that we’re still trying to climb our way out of.

Only 2 out of the past 25 months have been considered wetter than average in the rainfall department.

Looking ahead to the next seven days, a relatively calmer weather pattern takes over, unfortunately, meaning no significant chances for rain. We’ll keep eyes on it!

Fifth-year senior Donovan has accomplished new feats as a dual-sport student-athlete after competing in two events as a member of the women’s cross country team, finishing as the Vulcans’ leading runner in both races and matching the UH Hilo women’s soccer single-game record of six scored points during their match against Hawaiʻi Pacific University ( HPU ) on October 8.

Donovan made her debut as a collegiate runner at the Chaminade Invitational on Oʻahu with a No. 12 finish, just 14 hours after logging 54 minutes in the Vulcans women’s soccer team’s victory over Stanislaus State.

The UH Hilo women’s soccer team sits at No. 6 in the NCAA Division II with an overall record of 8-0-1.

After a successful first season with claims as PacWest Conference Championships Individual Co-Champion and PacWest Conference Freshman of the Year, Im started his sophomore campaign with back-to-back top 10 finishes. The UH Hilo men’s golf team opened the fall 2023 slate in Washington with Im finishing tied for third at the Saint Martin’s University Bishop Invitational and tied for sixth at the Western Washington University Invitational just a few days later.

"'A 5.1-magnitude earthquake was reported on the Big Island of Hawaii on Monday (December 4), according to the United States Geological Survey.

The earthquake was reported to be felt across the island with 1,100 residents claiming to have felt shaking when it hit at approximately 5:54 p.m. local time. The 5.1-magnitude natural disaster's epicenter was reported to be located at the Kilauea Volcano.

There was no tsunami threat in relation to the earthquake, though additional aftershocks were possible, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency announced in a post shared on its social media accounts. The initial earthquake and a 3.0-magnitude aftershock were reportedly unrelated to volcanic activity, the USGS's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory confirmed in a statement shared on its website.

"'H

is name followed him everywhere. Snow. Snowbeat. Snowy Strong. Not because it was unique, but because he was the type of person that people couldn’t forget.

His intelligence, confidence and passion for storytelling stood out from the first time he stepped into 744 Ostrom Ave. — The Daily Orange’s house. He was so good that as a sophomore, editors had to create a beat just for him — the “Snowbeat” — where he wrote about SU’s opposing players and coaches.

That name — and Chris Snow’s name — stuck instantly and didn’t go away. As editors budgeted upcoming stories, they’d write “FB” for football, “MBB” for men’s basketball and so on. For Snow’s stories, it was just his name.

Two decades later, the Snowbeat still exists at The D.O., a way for younger, nascent writers to begin making their mark. Snow’s personal stamp on the newspaper — the Snowbeat is the paper’s only beat named after someone — foreshadowed the impact he left everywhere he went in life.

His public battle with ALS inspired others battling the progressive, incurable nervous system disease, and the “Snowy Strong for ALS” campaign for ALS research raised over $500,000. Over the past four years, Snow approached the fatal disease the same way he approached everything else: with confidence and strength, just like he had as a Syracuse student writing for The D.O., as a sportswriter and as an NHL executive.

“You never met Chris Snow and came away forgetting about him,” said Jeff Passan, a longtime friend and SU classmate.

Snow died Sept. 30 after going into cardiac arrest. He was 42.

“Chris should be remembered not by who he was in the past tense, but in the very living ways he’s with us right now,” longtime friend Dave Levinthal said. “And if we have to go into the past tense, I’ll remember him as the best of us. He’s just somebody who I wish everyone had a chance to meet because they would have been better for it.”

hen he was diagnosed in 2019, doctors gave Snow a year to live. An experimental gene therapy called Tofersen began that summer, limiting the progression of the disease. Only about 10% of ALS cases are genetic, and Snow saw his father, cousin and two uncles succumb to the disease.

But unlike them, Snow, as a member of the Calgary Flames front office, possessed a platform to raise awareness. He and his wife, Kelsie, went public with the diagnosis in January 2020, posting updates on social media and Kelsie’s blog, “Sorry, I’m Sad.” For his 40th birthday in August 2021, he threw out the first pitch at Fenway Park, the same ballpark where he covered hundreds of games as a young writer with The Boston Globe.

“This is not the typical story that most people with ALS have,” Snow told The D.O. in 2021. “The path I took is the one I did because I have a platform that (my relatives) didn’t have.”

Snow displayed his typical strength battling ALS — he “went after that motherf*cker,” longtime friend Greg Bishop said. Snow was doing so well he made people forget how serious the disease is, said longtime friend Michael Rothstein. He kept going into work every day as the Flames’ assistant general manager, and in July, Kelsie recorded Snow mowing the lawn despite “almost no use of his hands and arms.”

“It took amazing courage to go that route and be out there and say, ‘Look, this is who I am right now. These are my circumstances, but the stuff that’s core to me that’s important, that’s not going to change,’” said Snow’s close friend Dave Curtis. “And he crushed it. He really did.”

That, of course, was nothing new to Snow. His writing and persona oozed maturity and talent. Curtis said Snow’s writing — as a freshman in college — could’ve appeared in The Syracuse Post-Standard.

There’s an irony that Snow was on the first Snowbeat, Rothstein said. Since Snow started it, the beat has been intended for writers that editors feel have the potential to be great, and he was always the one believing in others’ potential. While many editors at the time were quick to judge a new writer, Snow would often say the writer just “wasn’t good yet,” classmate and friend Eli Saslow recalled.

“He was just so friggin’ optimistic,” Saslow said. “Of course, sometimes, he ended up being disappointed. But he was unfailingly optimistic about people’s potential, which is just a great way to live your life.”

hen Curtis’ sports writing career admittedly got off to a “slower start” than some of his classmates, Snow encouraged him to stay with it. “You can’t give up yet,” he said to Curtis. “Hang in there. It’ll work for you. What can I do for you?”

Snow put in a good word at The Globe to help classmate Chico Harlan land an internship there, which Harlan — now a veteran Washington Post reporter — called a “career-maker.” Later, as a member of the Minnesota Wild’s front office, Snow helped another former classmate, Christian Tomas, secure an interview and job offer as team beat writer.

Last month, Bishop wrote a column in Sports Illustrated about his relationship with Snow. The response was overwhelming. Bishop heard from 50-60 people, some of whom Snow took under his wing and befriended as they worked their way into hockey analytics.

“He found a way to believe in people,” Rothstein said. “I mean, he believed in me when I think there were a lot of people that didn’t.”

On the basketball court, Snow believed he was the one who could save his pickup team of fellow ninth-floor Brewster Hall residents even though he “couldn’t shoot for sh*t,” as Bishop said.

Snow also thought he was the best ticket scalper ever, Rothstein said, and whether it was the 2002 Big East Tournament or Michael Jordan’s last game against the Chicago Bulls, he believed he could find him and his friends a way in. Because to Snow, “doing it was always better than not doing it,” Curtis explained. Even if he came up short, like he did for the Wizards-Bulls game, Snow kept fighting. He stayed outside the arena, trying to scalp into the second quarter, unwilling to accept his “ultimate defeat,” as his longtime friend and former SU roommate Dan Bosch recalled.

In 2006, at 25 years old, Snow left his position — a dream job — covering the Red Sox for The Globe, to work as director of hockey operations for the Minnesota Wild. Snow had covered the team for the The Minneapolis Star Tribune after graduating from SU, and he chose the Wild job over an offer from Sports Illustrated, Curtis recalled. Snow asked Curtis over a round of golf and dinner at Bertucci’s in Braintree, Massachusetts if making a “complete leap of faith” to Minnesota was the right decision. Most writers had to work through stops in three or four smaller markets to earn a job like Snow’s in Boston, Rothstein said. That’s just how good Snow was.

The career change landed him in Esquire and ultimately paid off. After four years in Minnesota, Snow became the Flames’ director of analytics. His acumen for statistics and storytelling worked hand in hand as he introduced the data analytics he observed Theo Epstein, Jed Hoyer and Ben Cherrington implement to end the Red Sox’ World Series drought.

“The guy showed he could be successful in legitimately anything he wanted to be,” Rothstein said. “People like that just don’t exist.”

n 2005, Snow met Kelsie when both were writing for The Globe. Kelsie was a summer intern rooming with Adam Kilgore, a former classmate and D.O. colleague of Snow’s, and went to the White Horse Tavern with Kilgore, Snow and Pete Thamel on one of her first nights in Boston. Snow asked Kilgore if there were any attractive interns, to which Kilgore replied, “You mean besides Kelsie, the girl sitting right next to us?” A frazzled Snow stuttered before telling Kelsie she had cute hair, Kilgore recalled.

Kelsie wrote it took just 10 minutes for her to fall in love with Snow’s smile, eyes and laugh. Kilgore said the two were made for each other — he later told Kelsie he had never seen two people fall so deeply in love with each other so purely and quickly.

One day that summer, Globe editors jokingly replaced Kelsie’s maiden name with “Snow” on her byline. It became reality two years later on a frigid December day in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Kelsie became an immovable part of Snow’s life. They had two children, Cohen and Willa, and the whole family served as an “inspiration” to others, Bosch said. The most emotional part of Snow’s memorial service in Calgary was when Cohen, 12, leaned into the microphone and called Snow his “best friend,” Passan said.

“Over the last three or four years, Chris and Kelsie and their whole family taught me so much even though none of that was through interpersonal conversation,” Saslow said. “It was just through watching as a family how you go through something really f*cking hard.”

Snow had friends who would do anything for him, too. Tomas offered to take a year off from his World Bank job to help Snow after hearing about his diagnosis. Curtis wasn’t going to propose to his girlfriend until she met Snow multiple times.

Rothstein, an Atlanta Falcons reporter for ESPN, called his bosses after hearing about Snow’s cardiac arrest: “I’m not missing this,” he told them. “I don’t care if I miss a game, I don’t care what you guys say, whatever it is — this is important to me. I need to be there for my friends, and my friend, and his family. Because Chris Snow mattered to me. Greatly.”

A

s Snow’s health declined last month, Passan, Bishop and Rothstein sent pictures of him in a group chat. Rothstein has combed through old emails to preserve memories of Snow, and photos of Snow and a brochure from the funeral sit on his nightstand. Next to them are “Snowy Strong” pins, which Rothstein wears while covering games in addition to the “Snowy Strong” stickers already on his two laptops. They’re there for the constant memory of someone who influenced his life greatly, he said.

Snow’s friends tried to plan trips to Calgary, but the pandemic got in the way. One idea was to go to Banff, a resort town outside of Calgary, for a few days around Snow’s 40th birthday. It never came to fruition.

After the formal memorial service at St. Michael Catholic Community on Oct. 12 and reception at the Flames’ home, Scotiabank Saddledome, Kelsie invited about 25-30 people to the Snow’s house. They went there to sit and tell stories about Chris — the storyteller — for hours, with Kelsie leading the way. Some were funny, some were deep and personal and some would’ve been forgotten if they involved anyone else.

“That was the sad part, right? That we had this moment together and we were late,” Curtis said. “Because he couldn’t be part of it.”

Even though ALS stripped Snow of his distinct, booming laugh and radiant, toothy smile, he remained the husband, father and storyteller he always was. And ALS didn’t stop him from leaving impressions on nearly everyone he met.

Passan said Snow didn’t die — he just lived until it was time to stop living. He did the things he wanted to do, and did them with dignity and meaning. “What it showed to other people was not just how strong someone can be, but how strong he actually was,” Passan said.

Snow should be remembered for his deep, meaningful inner passion about what he did, Bishop said.

“I can say a million things,” Bishop said, “but I think you can do it in one word:

“Strong.”

"'The Gila Bend community was devastated by flooding in 2021 that killed two people and displaced over 100 residents.

Example video title will go here for this video

GILA BEND, Ariz. — The Gila Bend United Softball Field is much more than just a field.

It serves as a symbol of recovery for the Town of Gila Bend, a community that was devastated by a destructive monsoon flood two years ago.

“This is really a good thing for the whole community.” said Gila Bend Mayor Tommy Sikes.

It’s a symbol of the unwavering spirit of the Gila Bend community.

“We are rebuilding, we are coming back,” said Dr. Rob Varner, Superintendent of the Gila Bend Unified School District. “A lot of good things are happening here. A lot of positive things are happening here. And just getting over trauma takes time. I think just this is definitely a symbol, to remember those folks that that lost their lives, lost their homes.”

The softball field, located just south of Gila Bend High School, now stands as a testament to the relationships that were forged and renewed throughout Maricopa County.

“In times of crisis, you know, people either fall apart or they come together,” said Kathy Valenzuela, the town manager for Gila Bend. “I really feel like in terms of Gila Bend, we saw different partners come together as a community, and certainly something that speaks to kind of small-town America, which is what Gila Bend is.""

The August 14, 2021 flood killed two people and stranded dozens on their rooftops, escaping the flood waters. More than 100 people were displaced after the flood. The Town of Gila Bend worked closely with Maricopa County, who freed up emergency funds to help the town clean up and rebuild.

Country Supervisor Steve Gallardo played a big part in the Gila Bend Unified Softball Field project.

“At the end of the day, it was a really traumatic experience, but I do think that some of the most meaningful things that came about as a result of that... those strengthened relationships, and just a true sense of community,” said Valenzuela.

The Gila Bend Unified Softball Field will be a place for the community to gather, reflect, and heal.

(TSX-V:PEGA)(Frankfurt:0QS0)(OTC PINK:SLTFF) (the ""Company"" or ""Pegasus"") is pleased to announce the analytical results from its 2023 ground exploration program at the Punch Bowl Property, Golden Project in east-central British Columbia (See news release October 06, 2023).

Exploration Highlights:

Abbreviated late fall reconnaissance program included 25 rock samples, with seven (7) having returned greater than 0.13 g/t Au

Three samples returned values of 4.70 g/t Au, 3.87 g/t Au and 1.61 g/t Au

The 2023 samples extended mineralization of the gold bearing quartz vein set to approximately 200 m along strike

Located previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein(s) on McGilvary Ridge

A late fall exploration program was carried out at the company's Punch Bowl Property on October 6th and 7th, 2023, with a total of 25 grab samples collected (Figure 1). Due to the unprecedented Forest Fire activity across Canada in 2023, the company was limited to an abbreviated exploration program which had been scheduled for earlier in the field season.

Samples targeted pyrite-bearing quartz veins within northwest-southeast trending recessive phyllitic lenses that have historically returned elevated gold values of up to 573.7 g/t Au (Shaw, 1989). Overall, the program was successful in extending mineralization along strike of known auriferous veins, in addition to locating a previously unsampled mineralized quartz vein.

""The Company is greatly encouraged by the results from the exploration campaign at the Punch Bowl Property,"" stated Chris Timmins, President and CEO of Pegasus. ""The assays show that the mineralization observed within the quartz veins is relatively continuous along strike, and the newly discovered quartz vein displays the potential for multiple mineralized zones on McGillivray Ridge. We look forward to continuing to advance this project during the summer of 2024.""

About the Golden Project:

The Golden Project is comprised of three distinct claim groups, from south to North: Gold Mountain, Vertebrae Ridge and Punch Bowl.

Punch Bowl:

The Punch Bowl Property consists of three mineral claims totalling 3,079 ha and is approximately 90 km NW of the company's Gold Mountain Property and 140 km NW of Golden, BC. The property surrounds the historic Punch Bowl Showing, where discrete gold in quartz veins are hosted within quartzites and pelites of the Early Cambrian McNaughton Formation.

Vertebrae Ridge:

The Vertebrae Ridge property is comprised of four claims encompassing about 5,324 ha (13,156 acres) roughly 81 kilometers northwest of Golden, BC. During August 2021 ground exploration resulted in the extension of known polymetallic mineralization trends, the confirmation of significant mineralization continuity at historically sampled locations, and the discovery of the Canon Cu-Au Zone. The Company believes the newly discovered Canon Zone may be related to a large oval, alkaline intrusion located a short distance west of the mineralized area.

Gold Mountain:

The Gold Mountain Property is an early-stage gold/silver property located approximately 50 km NW of Golden, BC, just north of Highway 1. The property comprises two mineral claims encompassing 802 ha and covering the historic Grizzly Occurrence, which consists of gold and silver mineralization within polymetallic quartz/carbonate veins.

Quality Assurance / Quality Control

All samples were collected in the field using a hammer and chisel. Locations were obtained using a handheld GPS or tablet, with samples placed in pre-labelled sample bags. Metal tags with the sample numbers and flagging tape were left at each sample location. A Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocol was incorporated into the program and included the insertion of silica blanks at a rate of approximately 15%.

Samples were transported to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89), which includes drying at 105�C, crushing to 75% passing 2mm, riffle splitting 250 g, and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns. They were analyzed for multi-element (code GE_ARM3V25) and Au by fire assay (code GE_FAA30V5).

Management cautions that prospecting surface rock samples and associated assays, as discussed herein, are selective by nature and represent a point location and, therefore, may not necessarily be fully representative of the mineralized horizon sampled.

"'A Jewish luxury handbag mogul is warning that antisemitism and anti-Zionism are like ""the new black"" in celebrity culture after it was revealed that the son of the founder of the high-end fragrance brand, Jo Malone, associated with highly controversial pro-Hamas Harvard student statement.

First reported by the Daily Mail, 22-year-old Josh Wilcox, the son of perfume mogul Jo Malone is listed as one of the three students who lead the Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee – the group behind a letter that put sole blame on Israel for the massacre carried out by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Jeffery Berk, CEO of the luxury handbag resale marketplace Privé Porter, called out the stark contrast among some in celebrity culture to the tragedy unfolding in the Jewish community to the events in 2020 such as George Floyd’s death and rise of the Black, Lives Matter (BLM) movement.

""Antisemitism and anti-Zionism have become mainstream. It really is ‘the new black,’ all the cool kids are doing it. Why not? All the cool celebrities seem to be OK with it,"" Berk said.

ISRAEL SINGLES OUT MODEL GIGI HADID FOR ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR POST: 'NOTHING VALIANT ABOUT HAMAS' MASSACRES'

""Years ago, there was a tidal wave of support for BLM, certainly boosted by the George Floyd tragedy. Heinous indeed, it was a race to be first for celebrities and brands to chime in. This past Friday there was a battle cry heard around the world for a day of rage against the Jews, one of the smallest minority groups in the world,"" Berk said.

""The celebrities this time around? Kylie Jenner posted, then took it down from pushback,"" Berk said, noting other celebrities have taken a ""both sides"" approach.

Earlier this year, Berk launched a nonprofit, TruthTells, aimed at holding politicians accountable when they make antisemitic remarks or are anti-Israel. The seed money for the group came from a $275,000 one-of-a-kind sale to Ye, formerly Kanye West, which Berk rerouted to TruthTells after West's public antisemitic tirade.

""It took only hours for a forest fire to rage throughout American universities for alleged Palestinian solidarity. When the idea Israel’s actions were in response to terrorists killing citizens from many countries, all they did was double down,"" Berk added.

Berk said that as Jewish students ""literally feared for their lives,"" administration’s ""did nothing.""

The reason? ""Antisemitism and anti-Zionism have become mainstream,"" he repeated. ""It really is ‘the new black,’ all the cool kids are doing it. So much for safe spaces.""

HERE'S WHERE STUDENTS FOR JUSTICE IN PALESTINE HELD COLLEGE PROTESTS THIS WEEK

Celebrites like Gigi Hadid, Justin Bieber and Mark Ruffalo are among A-listers who took an anti-Israel or ""both sides"" approach. Bieber posted on Instagram that he is ""hurting for both my Israeli and Palestinian friends,""

""I'm pretty sure we all instinctively know evil when we see it. To villainize all Palestinians or all Israeli people to me seems wrong. I'm not interested in choosing sides, but I am interested in standing with the families who have been brutally taken from us.""

""It is horrific to see innocent civilians killed and held hostage, and there is no justification for it. We pray for their safety, as we pray for the safety of the innocent people of Gaza who are being bombarded and besieged,"" Ruffalo posted on X.

After days of notable silence surrounding the harrowing terror attacks against Israel that shook the global community, supermodel Gigi Hadid took to Instagram last week to reaffirm her ""deep empathy for the Palestinian struggle.

Hadid, whose father is Palestinian and has previously spoken out in support of Palestinian fighters, failed to mention Hamas by name but condemned the ""terrorizing of innocent people"" under the guise of the ""Free Palestine movement.""

The Jo Malone brand was acquired by Estee Lauder in 1999. Following the reports on Wilcox, Jo Malone London appeared to distance itself from its founder in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, saying, ""This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and please know we do not condone violence of any kind. At this time, we would like to clarify that Jo Malone the individual has not been affiliated with the Jo Malone London brand since 2006. We continue to lead with kindness.""

According to the Daily Mail report, his mother, Jo, didn’t address her son, but said the war in the Middle East had left her ""heartbroken"" as she branded the attack by Hamas as ""abhorrent.""

According to the Daily Mail, Wilcox made a statement that he does ""not support the letter’s attribution of blame for Saturday’s attacks to Israel.""

""I'd like to make clear my personal views in relation to the open letter released by the PSC on October 8th,"" he said in the statement.

""Over the past few days, we have seen horrific massacres in Israel and as I write this, we are seeing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises unfold in Gaza. In contrast to the PSC open letter, I believe that anyone who inflicts violence on civilians is solely responsible for their actions. Therefore do not support the letter’s attribution of blame for Saturday’s attacks to Israel. Terrorism is never justified under any circumstances,"" he said.

Wilcox said he hasn’t been on Harvard’s campus this semester and ""was not involved in the drafting or release of the letter.""

The statement led by Palestine Solidarity Committee and originally co-signed by roughly 30 student groups was released the evening of Oct. 8, a day after the attacks that resulted in the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust. It said Hamas' killing, torture and kidnapping of Israelis ""did not occur in a vacuum.""

HUNDREDS OF HARVARD FACULTY SIGN LETTER REBUKING UNIVERSITY LEADERS' TEPID RESPONSE TO HAMAS 'WAR CRIMES'

""The apartheid regime is the only one to blame,"" the statement said, indicating the organizations believed Israel was responsible for the attacks.

""In the context of the unfolding events, this statement can be seen as nothing less than condoning the mass murder of civilians based only on their nationality,"" the faculty letter states. ""We’ve heard reports of even worse instances, with Harvard students celebrating the ‘victory’ or ‘resistance’ on social media.""

Several students associated with those groups have since denounced the statement after mounting scrutiny from Harvard faculty and business leaders.

Still, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapters at nearly two dozen colleges and universities across the country held events in support of the Palestinians following Hamas' terrorist attacks in Israel.

Cooper Flagg, the consensus top player in the 2024 recruiting class, said Thursday that his focus is on the tragedy of a mass shooting in his home state of Maine, an indication that an announcement on where he will play college basketball could be delayed.

The 6-foot-9 small forward has been deciding between Duke and defending national champion UConn.

There were reports he would announce his decision Thursday. But Flagg indicated in a social media post that would not happen.

“All of our focus should be on supporting the victims, their families, and law enforcement — everything else can wait,” Flagg said. “My heart is with Maine.”

Flagg plays at Montverde Academy in Florida, but is from Newport, Maine, about 80 miles from Lewiston, where at least 18 people were killed and 13 injured Wednesday night in shootings at a bowling ally and a restaurant.

Flagg had called Duke his dream school, but added the Huskies to the mix after an official visit in September, when he hung out with 7-2 center and family friend Donovan Clingan.

Flagg and Clingan's mothers had been teammates in the 1990s at Maine and the pair put up a post on social media showing them wearing replicas of their mothers' jerseys.

As a precaution, the City of Ventura closed its beaches from the Ventura Pier to Marina Park.

There is the potential for coastal street flooding, and damage to coastal structures like piers. The highest threat is expected during the mornings, because of waves coupling with high tides.

FIFA has opened an investigation into fan violence that delayed the start of Tuesday's 2026 World Cup qualifying match between Argentina and Brazil at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, according to the Associated Press (h/t ESPN).

World soccer's governing body has charged the Argentina football federation with crowd disturbances and the late kickoff and has also charged the Brazilian federation with failures of managing security at a game it organized.

Tuesday's game started 27 minutes late after brawls broke out among fans in the stands shortly after the national anthems were played. Pieces of seats and other objects were thrown during the fights, and at least one fan was left bleeding from his head, per Mauricio Savarese of the Associated Press.

Police used batons to break up the fights, and when Argentina returned to the field for the start of the game, officers surrounded the country's fans as they cheered on their team to victory.

Col. Vagner Ferreira blamed the game's organizers for what occurred prior to kickoff.

""Every action demands a reaction. There is a history of confrontation here. At first we spoke to them. Then, we had to use our batons. There was no lethal force involved, no rubber bullets, no tear gas. This was a very technical approach,"" Ferreira told TV channel SporTV.

Argentina went on to win the game 1-0 on a goal from Nicolás Otamendi in the 63rd minute and is now firmly atop the South American World Cup qualifying standings with 15 points. Brazil is sixth with seven points.

"'ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — In Florida, this year has been a tale of two states as far as rainfall totals, with the southeast coast deluged by sometimes-record rainfall and much of the Gulf of Mexico coast facing a drought.

Counties up and down Florida’s west side are under new water use restrictions, especially in one area where the water table has gotten so low that wells could dry up. Now Florida's wettest season is over until late spring.

What's happening in Florida could soon become a reality elsewhere, as farmers and residents increasingly have to deal with changes in weather patterns because of climate change. This means hotter temperatures in summer, more powerful hurricanes and other heavier rainstorms and droughts during unexpected seasons.

""You know, as the climate changes, we're going to have to adapt to these extremes,"" said Dan Durica, a board member at Tampa's Sweetwater Organic Community Farm. ""And so you have to know how to deal with like the boom and bust of the, like, climate chaos.""

For most people, the restrictions affect lawn and landscape watering, which accounts for about half the water used daily in the affected areas. For example, in three counties around Tampa Bay watering is only allowed one day a week depending on a resident’s address and only then before 8 a.m. or after 6 p.m.

""The whole western coast of Florida has been impacted by this deficit rainfall during the rainy season,"" said Mark Elsner, water supply bureau chief for the South Florida Water Management District. ""With the west coast having a deficit about 30%, we didn’t get that recharge that we expected. And as a result, we have lower groundwater levels starting the dry season.""

Region St Lucie County New construction and rising sea levels expected to worsen flooding in Florida Kate Hussey

The main driver of the precipitation divide was a weaker-than-typical high-pressure system this summer over the western Atlantic Ocean that led to persistently lighter easterly winds, said Robert Molleda of the National Weather Service office in Miami.

""This wind pattern tends to focus most of the precipitation over the interior and eastern side of the peninsula, rather than a more typical east wind pattern which would focus a lot of the daily summer thunderstorms over the western half of the peninsula,"" Molleda said in an email.

Indeed, in mid-November a no-name storm with wind gusts approaching tropical storm strength lashed Miami, Fort Lauderdale and nearby areas with readings approaching a foot (30 centimeters) of rain over three days, In the Florida Keys, the city of Marathon set an all-time daily record for November when 6.68 inches of rain fell in a single day.

In April, a storm that sat over Fort Lauderdale dumped nearly 25 inches of rain in some areas, causing many neighborhoods to flood. And just during the past 90 days, many parts of South Florida have been inundated again with between 150% and 200% of average rainfall totals, according to the weather service.

Over on the Gulf Coast, it's a different story. Drought has persisted for months. All or parts of 14 counties are under water use restrictions imposed by two water management districts that began last week and will remain in force until July, according to agency documents. This affects everything from lawn watering to golf courses to landscaping to agriculture.

""All wasteful water use such as hosing down driveways and impervious surfaces, allowing water to flow unattended and using water in a grossly inefficient manner, is prohibited,"" the Southwest Florida Water Management District website says.

Violators can be fined varying amounts depending on the jurisdiction. In Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, fines range from $100 for an initial offense to $500 for repeated violations, although a warning is given first.

One of the underground reservoirs Florida relies on, the Mid-Hawthorn Aquifer, is 15 feet lower this year compared with each of the past four years, according to the South Florida Water Management District. This is threatening supplies in wells in Cape Coral, which is just north of Fort Myers and is still recovering from last year's Hurricane Ian destruction.

Many wells in the area were drilled to shallower depths in past years and now could dry out if the aquifer does not recover, Elsner said.

""Today, they're drilling those wells deeper because we've seen water level declines. So those shallower wells are most susceptible to drying out,"" he said, noting that more than 100 permits for deeper replacement wells have been issued in Cape Coral during the past couple of years.

Farmers have many methods to reduce water use. Practices include slow-drip irrigation, deep mulching and watering at night when there is less evaporation, Durica said.

Even with all the water conservation efforts, Florida's west coast will need rain to truly ease the water shortage.

Forecasters say it's likely Florida will experience heavier rainfall than usual over the typically drier winter months because of a weather phenomenon known as El Nino, which occurs when waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean grow warmer, impacting climate worldwide.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts a 55% chance of a strong El Niño this winter.

""The hope is that with increased rainfall compared to normal this winter and spring, drought conditions would be alleviated,"" Molleda said. ""The latest drought outlook calls for a likely removal of drought conditions along the Florida Gulf coast sometime between December and February.""'",climate,drought

Wildlife has it hard in Hawaii. Suffering from internal and external parasites constantly sapping whatever energy they can get from the food they can find, families of sheep, goats and pigs struggle to survive, and must dodge dogs, hunters and government eradicators. Read more

Wildlife has it hard in Hawaii. Suffering from internal and external parasites constantly sapping whatever energy they can get from the food they can find, families of sheep, goats and pigs struggle to survive, and must dodge dogs, hunters and government eradicators. Many are shot and injured, escaping to merely slowly die from a gunshot wound or dog attack.

Now, with Hawaii in serious drought conditions, wildlife is suffering even more, and needs our help.

Unfortunately, in Hawaii there is a conflict between the humane treatment of animals, and the eradication of invasive species.

The problem is that most of Hawaii’s wildlife consists of species that the government is mandated to maintain for hunting and food security, including pigs, sheep and goats, but these species are now also considered “invasive” and are targeted for eradication.

This means the government must try to eradicate the same species it must try to protect and encourage.

A drought is nature’s way to cull wild animal populations. It requires no money or environmental review. And it presents wildlife officials with the option of providing water, using established watering stations, or leave these water stations empty, which has recently happened.

Of course, some people are concerned about the welfare of these animals, regardless of their immigration status. They may be nonnative animals, but some people believe they still should be given water and kept from starving. The politics of environmental nativism does not stop caring people from feeling compassion for animals.

Should you be humane to a species the government wants to eradicate, and give these animals water during a drought? To anyone who has a heart and has seen them suffering from drought, the answer is a resounding “yes.”

This should be self-evident for anyone who respects animals and their needs.

Besides ethical considerations, there are also practical reasons for supporting wildlife during the drought.

When animals are thirsty, they come to the edges of roads, looking for moisture. This increases traffic accidents.

Thirsty animals are more likely to girdle trees looking for moisture. Providing water to wildlife saves plants, too.

Droughts also cause reduced food, leading hungry animals to become a nuisance in agricultural and residential areas. Providing some food and water could help animals through the lean time, and mitigate damage from wildlife.

Maintaining wildlife that consumes wild grasses helps prevent overgrown grasslands and reduces fire risk from drought.

We must show respect and proper stewardship of Hawaii’s wildlife, which can sustain people during hard times. This goes for the government, too.

Keep in mind that, in addition to mammals, birds also need water and food during drought, as do lizards. Putting out a dish of water, some bird seed, and maybe a ripe banana would be much appreciated by the animals near you.

Everyone can make a difference. We all have seen images of people suffering from lack of food and water. Humans do not have a monopoly on the ability to suffer. And our sympathy and empathy is not limited to our species.

Feel the kinship we have with the other animals with whom we share these wonderful, but drought-suffering, islands. We’re all in this together.'",climate,drought

"'Despite an ongoing water shortage across the American West, Utah's major cities have the cheapest excessive-use water rates of all the surrounding states. (BlurryMe, Shutterstock)

Estimated read time: 6-7 minutes

ST. GEORGE — Despite an ongoing water shortage across the American West, Utah's major cities have the cheapest excessive-use water rates of all the surrounding states.

Southern Utah — where a combination of desert conditions and rapid population growth have fueled intense concerns over water — still has cheaper or similar water rates as the Wasatch Front.

KSL.com compared winter water fees in the cities of St. George, Washington, Salt Lake City and South Salt Lake, to the largest cities in neighboring states: Las Vegas, Boise, Phoenix, Denver and Cheyenne.

Water prices are calculated at the city level, with some additional fees imposed by water conservancy districts. Price calculations are found online at each city's website, and KSL.com reached out to representatives in various locations to confirm calculations and make amendments, as needed.

Water officials told KSL.com the average residence uses approximately 5,000 gallons of water per month. Most districts begin charging excessive-use rates for water between 5,000 and 8,000 gallons of residential use during winter months.

KSL.com estimated monthly water use for the standard meter size in each city at 5,000, 10,000, 15,000 and 20,000 gallons, using winter water rates.

Where is water cheapest

If homes across the West used four times greater the water amount than average, St. George has the cheapest bill. If a home in each city used 20,000 gallons of water in a month, St. George residents would still have the cheapest water bill, at $56.50.

South Salt Lake residents would be next, at $70.75.

Washington city residents would pay $74.22.

And Salt Lake City residents would pay $87.39.

If it doesn't drive up my cost, there's no motivation to conserve other than sense of guilt or morality, right? People need financial motivation to do the right thing. – Rusty Cannon, Utah Taxpayers Association

Residents in surrounding states would pay higher fees than every Utah city examined. The next cheapest water rates would be in Denver and Phoenix, at $93.45 and $100.56, respectively. But those rates will increase in 2024 to over $107 each, in order to fund water infrastructure improvements and incentivize conservation.

Utah cities do not have rate hikes — beyond inflationary adjustments — planned for the same time period.

All other cities examined are already in the hundreds, with Las Vegas and Boise being the most expensive, at $152.77 and $178.88, respectively.

Excessive-use rate hikes hit new homes in southern Utah

In January 2023, the Washington County Water Conservancy — which serves much of southern Utah, including Washington and St. George — imposed an excessive-use charge of $10 for every thousand gallons of water above 8,000 gallons used. But the fee only applies to homes built in 2023 or after.

""Our general policy is that we feel it's a fundamental right for people to have clean, safe drinking water,"" said Zachary Remstrom, general manager at the Washington County Water Conservancy District. ""We have a lot of people on fixed incomes or we have a lot of people on Social Security. So we want to make that initial allotment of water as cheap as possible.""

""Once they get past that initial amount of what you need to live and be happy and healthy, our rates go up very aggressively, and we think that that should happen,"" he continued.

""The new rate that we have for new homes is one of the highest in the state of Utah — if not in the western United States,"" Renstrom said.

The fee does make the excessive-use of water in newly built southern Utah homes among the most expensive of the major surrounding cities, with St. George homeowners who use 20,000 gallons of water paying $176.50 and Washington homeowners $194.22.

However, existing homes will not incur excessive-use fees unless they use more than 36,000 gallons of water, after which they would be charged an additional $1 per thousand gallons used.

Ed Andrechak, water program manager at Conserve Southwest Utah, said 25% of people use 36,000 gallons of water or more and, ""with some of the lowest water prices in the West — and the country, it provides a huge disincentive towards conservation.""

South Salt Lake also has an excessive-use water fee of an additional $3.25 per 1,000 gallons of water over 5,000 used, which was included in previously mentioned figures.

These excessive-use fees do little to offset Utah's comparably cheap water use in existing homes.

Utah water conservation officers talk about easy ways to save water and money KSL.com talked to the water officials across Utah to help you save water and money this time of year.

Should Utah do away with subsidies that deflate water costs?

Rusty Cannon, president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, says excess-use fees on new homes in southern Utah are ""a step in the right direction,"" but ""it does not go far enough.""

""Utah, for a long time, has heavily subsidized water with property taxes and that needs to change. We've tried to help make that change for decades, but it's it is a very difficult battle,"" Cannon said.

""Water in Washington County does not reflect the true cost to supply it,"" Andrechak added. ""Pricing is the easiest switch.""

""Status quo is the No. 1 enemy,"" Cannon said. ""Meaning, this is the way we've always done it — don't change it and you know, (water districts) argue that they need that property tax subsidy to build the infrastructure projects that they need to provide the water ... but we don't think that's true.

""Most other states rely heavier on user fees, and bonds structures could be changed, going forward, to accommodate a revenue stream based on user fees.""

Once they get past that initial amount of what you need to live and happy healthy, our rates go up very aggressively, and we think that that should happen. – Zachary Renstom, Washington County Water Conservancy District

""If it doesn't drive up my cost, there's no motivation to conserve other than sense of guilt or morality, right? People need financial motivation to do the right thing. And this subsidy makes it tough to do that,"" Cannon said.

A 2023 report from the University of Utah Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute estimates over 90% of Utahns pay subsidized water rates, and cites figures that for every 10% increase in water rates, consumption declines 2.5% to 7.5%.

Attempts to repeal water subsidies were run unsuccessfully during the 2021 and 2022 Utah legislative sessions.

""We make an attempt every year,"" said Cannon. ""We don't have anything specific coming up this session, but the effort will always continue.""

Various state representatives told KSL.com they were not planning to run a subsidy removal bill for the upcoming session, which begins Jan. 16, but that could change. People interested in weighing in on subsidies or who have other water proposals should contact their state officials.

"'The threat of flooding can continue even after the rain is done.

It takes time for heavy rainfall to seep into streams and creeks and eventually the larger rivers like the Lehigh and the Delaware. Flood watches and warnings can persist for hours or days after the final raindrops have fallen.

The National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service website at water.weather.gov provides real-time observations from river gauges, and in some spots will forecast anticipated river crests.

This screenshot of the National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service website shows river gauge forecasts in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The service shows where flooding is happening or expected.National Weather Service Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service

For the Lehigh Valley, forecast gauges are in place on the Jordan Creek in Allentown, on the Lehigh River at Walnutport and Bethlehem, and on the Delaware River at Tocks Island, Belvidere, Easton and Riegelsville.

Additionally, current observations are available for Spring Creek at Trexlertown, the Little Lehigh Creek in Allentown, and the Lehigh River at Glendon.

Clicking through any of those points on the map at the hydrologic prediction website will show how current levels relate to each location’s thresholds for action level, or minor, moderate and major floods. Records are usually listed, along with descriptions of what happens when the water reaches certain levels — for instance, Larry Holmes Drive in Easton will flood when the Delaware River reaches 24 feet.

For flood watches or warnings, the weather service alerts for the Lehigh Valley can be found at weather.gov/PHI. That’s the agency’s website for its Mount Holly, New Jersey, office which covers Philadelphia, the Lehigh Valley, the southern Poconos, most of New Jersey including the shore, all of Delaware and parts of Maryland.

Flood watch or flood warning?

When the National Weather Service issues a flood watch, it means that conditions are right or anticipated for flooding to happen.

A flood warning is more serious. That means that flooding is imminent or happening.

No one should attempt to drive across water-covered roads, regardless of weather alert status.

Will any of Otis’s rain make it to Alabama? It doesn’t appear so.

NOAA’s Weather Prediction Center is forecasting little to no rain for Alabama over the next week. Alabama remains situated under a dome of high pressure, which is keeping temperatures on the warm side and rain chances on the very low side.

Alabama is not expected to get much, if any, rain over the next seven days. The seven-day precipitation outlook is above.Weather Prediction Center

Any moisture from Otis that manages to make it this far north will be shunted to the west of Alabama.

Alabama is in the midst of a worsening drought, and conditions are not likely to improve in the near future.

People cross a street amid an alert for heatwave, in Shanghai

BEIJING (Reuters) - The heat in China was relenting in 2023 with temperature records broken from Beijing to Shanghai, echoing the global heatwave phenomena that also engulfed most of the world and raised more concerns about global climate change.

China's searing heat led to 127 national weather stations breaking records for daily high temperatures in 2023, state media reported on Tuesday.

Beijing smashed a 23-year-old record in July with 27 consecutive days of temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius (95 Fahrenheit).

The national average temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius (51.3 Fahrenheit), the highest since 1961 and 0.8 degrees Celsius higher than a normal reading of 9.9 Celsius (49.8F), broke the record of 10.5 Celsius (50.9F) set in 2021, state broadcaster CCTV said.

Most of the country was 0.5-1 degrees Celsius warmer. The average temperature in 13 provinces, cities or regions including Beijing, Shandong, Liaoning, Xinjiang and Henan were all at the highest since 1961, CCTV said.

China experienced a stretch of record-breaking heat and extreme weather, with readings at one weather station in the far northwestern region of Xinjiang on July 16 hitting an all-time high of 52.2 degrees Celsius (126 Fahrenheit).

The heat also baked Europe, India, North Africa, many parts of the southern United States and swathes of Southeast Asia. The hottest day ever recorded globally was July 3, according to data from the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction.

The average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 Fahrenheit), surpassing the August 2016 record of 16.92 Celsius (62.46F).

China's weather extreme was not limited to heat as torrential rains drenched many parts of the country in the summer, especially after several typhoons hit the mainland.

A total of 55 national weather stations across the country recorded daily precipitation exceeding the historical extreme value, according to CCTV.

China is likely to face even hotter temperatures and more frequent and powerful weather extremes in 2024, chief expert at the country's National Climate Center has warned.

MONROE COUNTY, Tenn. — People in Monroe County may soon spot areas of the Cherokee National Forest that appear to be on fire. There's a chance sightings like that can be related to planned and controlled burns in the area.

Forest leaders said in a press release that firefighting crews are planning to conduct controlled burns on Forest Service property starting Monday through the winter months. The burns are conducted following a plan that calls for specific weather conditions, smoke dispersion, and other environmental conditions.

As a result of those specific conditions, the release said the decision to conduct a controlled burn often cannot be made until the day of the burn. So, information about specific days when controlled burns would happen was not immediately available.

However, the release said those conditions are usually seen during winter months.

"'The Washington Mystics’ 2023 year began with promise but ultimately was a mediocre season derailed by injuries. Do I see next year being a positive for Washington’s WNBA team? Let’s take a look below.

Prediction 1: The Mystics re-sign Elena Delle Donne and Natasha Cloud, but not at max salaries

Washington begins the 2024 free agency period with five to six open roster spots and three protected veteran spots available. Along with about $639,809 in cap space according to Her Hoop Stats. That’s not a lot of room for the Mystics to make any significant moves.

Delle Donne was the Mystics’ highest paid player last year with $234,350 but is an unrestricted free agent. She has accomplished all of the major accolades for her career, from MVPs, to Gold Medals and a WNBA championship. I think she will spend the rest of her career in Washington, but will do so by taking a lower salary in the hopes that the Mystics can add another free agent.

Natasha Cloud is coming off a career season where she made $190,000 in 2023. Like Delle Donne, Cloud has been happy to be in D.C. by all accounts, so I see her resigning as well. However, for the Mystics to be in position to get a significant free agent, she too will have to take a lower salary.

Prediction 2: Myisha Hines-Allen will be on the proverbial “hot seat” as she enters a contract year

The Mystics could be in prime position to make a big move in 2024 if they had multiple All-Stars. Last year, they had none, partly because of the injuries. But I don’t see them willing to move Brittney Sykes or Ariel Atkins who are making up to $200,000 each.

Of the remaining players on contract for 2024, Myisha Hines-Allen is making $180,200 next season on the last year of her three-year near-max contract, but I don’t see the Mystics being able to move her.

Since her 2020 All-WNBA season, Hines-Allen has either been often-injured like in 2021 and hasn’t played like she did in the Florida bubble. She shot just 34 percent from the field in 2023, coming off knee surgery. Furthermore, Hines-Allen’s on a guaranteed contract, so the Mystics can’t cut her and see that money go to another free agent.

Since the Mystics probably can’t sign another All-Star player outright if they bring back Delle Donne and Cloud to veteran salaries in the $120 to $150,000 range, Hines-Allen has an opportunity to be the “X Factor” if they make a marked improvement in the standings next season.

Prediction 3: Ariel Atkins is the only Mystics player on the USA Basketball women’s national team for the 2024 Olympics

I feel this is a safe bet. Atkins was a member of the 2020 Olympic team where she played the role of defensive stopper on a team full of ball dominant players. I see her making the team again this summer, barring injury of course.

Prediction 4: The Mystics make the playoffs and host a playoff game. But will lose in the semifinals

Can you believe that the Mystics haven’t hosted postseason basketball at the Entertainment & Sports Arena since 2019? I can’t either.

Given that I see most of the 2023 core returning and more motivated than ever to do better than last season, I think the Mystics will finally get the camel off their backs and host a playoff game. They won’t get swept like each of the last two years in the first round.

However, the Mystics don’t have the sheer amount of star talent that top ranked teams like the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty have. I’d also put the Dallas Wings ahead of them too. So I’d imagine that the Mystics’ playoff run ends in the semifinals.

What predictions do you have in 2024 for the Mystics? Let us know in the comments below.'",sports,basketball
"'PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bryce Harper smashed the first pitch he saw on his 31st birthday into the seats, Kyle Schwarber hit his first homer of the postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Philadelphia Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series on Monday night.

Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate. Harper, who also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs, hit his 10th homer in two postseasons with the Phillies.

""I've always wanted to play on my birthday,"" he said before the game.

Zack Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending National League champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.

José Alvarado got four big outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the postseason after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.

The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving, deliriously-cheering fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave fans a reason to stop — or a chance for Arizona to catch its breath until it was too late.

Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen's first pitch 420 feet into the right-field seats. There was some minor consternation that Schwarber — with 47 homers this season and 93 over the last two — had yet to go deep through six playoff games. How easy it was to forget that Schwarber didn't hit any in the Wild Card Series or NLDS last season before he launched six in the NLCS and World Series. So those Schwarbombs might just be getting started.

""We know what type of guy Schwarber's going to be for us. He's huge in that 1 spot,"" Harper said. ""There's never a doubt on how good he's going to be. We're excited to see what he can do in the NLCS and as we go.""

Four pitches later, Harper homered — the first time in 127 postseason games Philadelphia went deep twice in the first inning.

When Castellanos lined his fifth homer of the playoffs in the third — all in the past three games — it gave the Phillies 32 home runs in 13 postseason games at Citizens Bank Park over the last two years.

The Kelce Bros approved. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — minus celebrity friend Taylor Swift — and Eagles center Jason Kelce went wild. Travis pointed to his brother as Jason pounded a beer in their suite.

Gallen, a South Jersey native, had his name derisively drawn out to ""Galll-ennnn"" by Phillies fans each time the 17-game winner got into a jam. Too many times, for Arizona.

Trea Turner hit a one-double in the third, leaving first base open. Gallen pitched to Harper instead of walking him and got burned by an RBI single for a 4-0 lead.

J.T. Realmuto added an RBI single in the fifth.

""Gallen, he's been throwing the ball well all year. Just tried to get on top of him as much as we could, score early,"" Harper said. ""Schwarber starting the game off right there was huge for us.""

Those runs proved crucial for the Phillies. Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run homer off Wheeler in the sixth that made it 5-2.

Seranthony Domínguez opened the door in the seventh for the Diamondbacks when his throwing error on a comebacker led to an unearned run. Alvarado retired pinch-hitter Emmanuel Rivera on a groundout to keep it 5-3 and tossed a scoreless eighth.

SNAKE EYES

The Diamondbacks, who at 84-78 squeezed into the playoffs as the final NL wild card, were held to four hits.

GOING DEEP

Schwarber's fourth leadoff homer in the postseason moved him past Jimmy Rollins and Derek Jeter for most in baseball history.

Harper joined St. Louis' Kolten Wong, Tampa Bay's Evan Longoria and Kansas City's Willie Aikens as the only players in postseason history to homer on his birthday.

Castellanos' five homers in his last three postseason game — he hit two in consecutive games against Atlanta — made him the second player to hit those marks. New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson did it in the 1977 World Series.

Arizona sends RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0 postseason, 0.00 ERA) to the mound for Game 2.

RHP Aaron Nola (2-0 postseason, 1.42 ERA) pitches for the Phillies. Nola is eligible for free agency after the World Series after he tabled contract extension talks with the team in spring training. Nola made $16 million this year on the club option that was part of the $45 million, four-year deal he signed ahead of the 2019 season. Nola said he wanted to stay in Philadelphia.

""I hope so. I really do,"" Nola said before the game. ""I love it here. Obviously, it's the only place I've been. I came up through some special times in the rebuilding era ask and getting to witness and be a part of a lot of different type of teams.""'",sports,baseball

"'As the founding president of the WNBA, Val Ackerman is thrilled with the direction of the league: skyrocketing TV rating, which were the league’s best in 21 years; new highs across digital platforms, social media engagement and sports betting; rising attendance that was up 16 percent this year from last.

The WNBA is in a great place, which is why Ackerman believes the time is right to increase its reach.

“I think the league is now ripe for expansion,” Ackerman, the Big East commissioner, told The Post in a phone interview. “You have to find the right markets and the right investors, who have the long view.

As recently as 2008, it was at 14 teams.

“We were never able to get into the Bay Area. I’m thrilled they’ve finally been able to crack that nut and get a team and a market that, I think, will be very receptive for women’s basketball,” Ackerman said.

Women’s basketball has been generating more interest of late, and it may only be getting better, with a number of high-profile college players, such as Caitlin Clark of Iowa, Angel Reese of LSU and Paige Bueckers and Azzi Fudd of Connecticut, set to turn pro in the coming years.

“The player pool can certainly support [expansion],” said Ackerman, a member of both the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame and Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. “When we expanded early, I’m not sure that we had really the depth of the pool of players to support growing to 16 teams. … The player pool is more robust now.”

One thing that never quite translated when it came to the WNBA was the popularity of women’s college basketball, in particular the NCAA Tournament.

That may be changing, though, especially as players build up their brands through their Name, Image & Likeness.

And unlike the men’s game, where players leave early for the NBA, women college basketball players must be at least 22 years of age, have completed their college eligibility, have graduated from a four-year college or be four years removed from high school.

“It does allow these young women to become household names, in the case of Caitlin Clark, in college,” Ackerman said.

This is an exciting time for Ackerman, as the new college basketball season nears and the Big East enters the season loaded after one of its teams, UConn, won it all a year ago.

She will also be one of the honorees at the The Buoniconti Fund’s 38th annual Great Sports Legends Dinner on Monday at the Marriott Marquis in Midtown.

Other sports luminaries include Michael Strahan, Missy Franklin, Jim Furyk, Zdeno Chara and Jim Thome.

The event raises money for spinal cord and brain injury and neurological disease research being done by researchers at The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis.

The Buoniconti Fund was established by the family in 1992 after Marc Buoniconti was paralyzed from the shoulders down during a college football game with The Citadel.

Father Nick, a two-time Super Bowl winner with the Dolphins who passed away in 2019, cofounded The Miami Project to help those like his son deal with spinal cord injuries.

“Very honored, of course,” Ackerman said. “To go in with other dignitaries like Michael Strahan and Missy Franklin and others, it’s going to be a really exciting event, probably emotional.”'",sports,basketball
"'The NFL will hold its second annual “John Madden Thanksgiving Celebration” on Thursday, November 23, with special tributes to the late head coach and beloved commentator.

This year, the league will pay tribute to Madden with a special turducken coin, jersey patches, and “John Madden Thanksgiving Celebration” stencils on the field.

Every game will also air a special NFL-produced “Madden Hallmark” at the start of the broadcast.

“There’s no place that I would rather be today on Thanksgiving than right here, right now, at a football game,” Madden says in the voiceover. “There’s just certain things that go together. You know, the turkey, the family, the tradition, football, and we have it all here today.”

The special edition coins will feature a silhouette of John Madden on the heads side, with a six-legged turducken on the reverse (tails) side.

Along with the visible tributes, each network airing a game will select a player of the game who will receive a $10,000 donation from the NFL Foundation to be given to a high school or youth football program in their name, as the topic of youth football was important to Madden, according to an NFL release.

Games will air on FOX, CBS, and NBC.

"'International SOS’s travel risk map for 2024 (International SOS)

The world’s most dangerous countries to visit in 2024 have been revealed in a new study.

South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Somalia were named as the riskiest nations in the 2024 risk map compiled by medical and security consultancy International SOS.

The annual map assesses various factors to inform travellers and businesses about potential threats in countries across the globe.

It pulls together medical and security risk ratings, reflecting the impact of events such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas.

This year, for the first time, the map also includes ratings based on the dangers of climate change, after International SOS saw a rising trend in the number of climate-related alerts being issued to clients as rising global temperatures increased health risks around the world.

The data, compiled by Inform (a collaboration between the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change and Joint Research Centre of European Commission), estimates the future risk of humanitarian crises and disasters caused by climate change.

“Just one example, the extreme heat events this year, with the first ever named heatwave Cerberus hitting Europe, may become commonplace,” said Dr Irene Lai, global medical director at International SOS.

“In addition to the physical impacts of extreme heat, there can be significant negative effects on mental health. It is essential businesses plan for this, adapting our way of living and working to protect health, while also taking steps to slow and eventually reverse the trend in rising temperatures.”

Countries were graded for each category of risk – medical, security and climate change – on a five-level scale ranging from “low” to “very high” for medical and climate change, and “insignificant” to “extreme” for security.

For “security”, Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Somalia were all given the highest warning level of “extreme”.

Parts of Lebanon, Palestinian Territories, Russia and across the Sahel all saw increases in security risk, alongside Ecuador and parts of Colombia following a rise in criminality and unrest.

However, risk ratings decreased for El Salvador and parts of Nepal as a result of sustained downward trends across a number of risk factors.

The safest countries, meanwhile, are all in Europe: Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland and Denmark.

In the “medical” category, the countries labelled “very high” risk are Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, North Korea, Palestinian Territories, Haiti, Libya, Niger, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Burundi and Somalia.

Countries at “very high” risk when it comes to climate change include: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Chad, Niger, Mali, Nigeria, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique.

The UK received a “low” rating across all three categories of risk.'",climate,forest fire
"'The Bureau of Meteorology has declared an El Niño event this summer, the first in Australia since 2015 - meaning it's time to plan for high temperatures in the coming months.

It's important to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to prevent heat-related illnesses. Here are some ways to help you beat the heat and stay safe this summer.

Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water throughout the day and avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption, as these can contribute to dehydration. Stay cool indoors. If the heat becomes unbearable, seek refuge in air-conditioned spaces like malls, libraries or community centres. Dress for the weather. Choose lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing to help keep your body cool. A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses provide additional protection from the sun. Plan activities wisely. Avoid strenuous activities and schedule outdoor activities during the cooler parts of the day, like early morning or evening. Seek shade. When outdoors, make use of shaded areas or umbrellas to escape direct sunlight. This can significantly reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses like heatstroke. Never leave anyone in a parked vehicle. Leaving children, animals or vulnerable individuals in a parked car, even for a few minutes, can be life-threatening. Always check your vehicle before locking it. Check on vulnerable individuals (and pets too!) to ensure they are coping with the heat. Monitor your health. Be aware of the signs of heat-related illnesses such as dizziness, rapid pulse, nausea and confusion. If you or someone you're with experiences these symptoms, move to a cooler place, hydrate and seek medical attention if necessary.

"'With Wednesday's win over the New York Liberty, the Aces became the first team to win back-to-back WNBA titles since the Sparks in 2001 and 2002.

Wilson led Las Vegas with 24 points and 16 rebounds during Wednesday's 70-69 victory over New York. She hit 11 of her 21 shots from the floor while earning one steal and one block. Guard Jackie Young added 16 points and seven assists in 37 minutes of play.

"'BLACK FOREST, CO — Instead of having to send their recruits to other classrooms, the Monument and Black Forest Fire Departments are going to train 15 recruits at one of their fire stations.

""We quickly recognized the need to create something new in El Paso County,"" said Chief Andy Kovacs of the Monument Fire Department. ""With that, the fire service, departments, need to grow with our community""

The Monument and Black Forest areas have seen growth just like anywhere else in El Paso County, and more people means more needed coverage.

The two departments have typically sent recruits to get trained in Lakewood and Colorado Springs, but both of those areas have seen growth as well.

""Unfortunately, because they are in need of firefighters, they didn't have the capacity to support us. So this venture with Pikes Peak College and Black Forest Fire was really to create a local academy that we could sustain year in and year out,"" said Kovacs.

The fire academy will host 15 recruits through a 640-hour course at the Black Forest Fire Rescue Station #1.

""It's a 16-week program, 5 days a week, Monday through Friday, 8 to 5 every day. They'll be doing physical training, classroom work, and then drilled around as well,"" said Jaimie Gutschick Co-Chair of Fire and Science Technology at Pikes Peak State College.

Gutschick says the program will also give future firefighters five different certifications that they need to join any fire department.

Fire officials hope this program will serve other areas in Colorado that also need more firefighters. Pooling resources for the benefit of the communities they protect.

""It's just really hard logistically, financially, the human resources that are required to do things like this. By getting together and partnering in these types of relationships, it really allows us the opportunity to do things we couldn't do ourselves,"" said Chief Kovacs.

The first classes are set to start in January of 2024.

"'By the time I joined Matt and Haley Bevacqua at their 20-year-old son’s Hillsboro apartment last Sunday, so much had disappeared. The furniture was gone, the living room empty. Barrett’s chef tools – his special knives and that essential measuring scale – were carefully packed away for the Bevacquas’ long drive home to Arizona.

“Barrett was teaching his roommates how to cook,” Haley Bevacqua said. “They would be at the academy 12 hours a day, then come home and have family dinner, the three of them. They would try to watch a movie, and Emily would routinely fall asleep. Either Michele or Barrett would pick her up, carry her to her bed, and tuck her in. They called her ‘Princess.’”

Barrett Bevacqua and Emily Hurd were student pilots at Hillsboro Aero Academy, and Michele Cavallotti, 22, an Italian-born flight instructor. On their last flight together, Cavallotti was training Bevacqua at the front of the Piper Seminole, Hurd sitting in the back.

Barrett and Emily

“She remembers everything,” Haley says, including the moment in the practice maneuver at 6,500 feet when Bevacqua handed control of the light twin plane back to Cavallotti. “She felt they did everything by the book. There was no screaming. They went through every check. They spoke very quietly, so not to worry her.

“Until the end, they were calm.”

The Piper fell into a terrifying spiral and broke apart atop a house in Newberg. Emily alone survived, with serious injuries. When a Newberg police detective called Matt to confirm Barrett’s death at 10:30 p.m., he first phoned Haley in Santa Fe, where she was working, then set out on the two-hour drive to find their 19-year-old daughter Brooklyn at the University of Arizona.

“I wasn’t going to call her and give her this,” Matt said. “We spent the entire night up. Crying. Consoling. You can imagine.”

I don’t know that we can.

I met the Bevacqua family eight years ago at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. Barrett pitched and played the infield corners for Wilshire Riverside, and he was already a Northeast Portland legend, team manager Matt Farr noted at the memorial service, thanks to an unforgettable dive at a state all-star tournament in Pendleton.

Chris Schuver (left) and Barrett Bevacqua at the Little League World Series in 2015.

On an off-day from baseball that week, the coaches took the squad to a park with a swimming pool and a 20-foot diving platform.

Naturally, an intense competition ensued off that platform. Barrett put so much goofy energy into his taekwondo take-off, Farr said, that “his bathing suit just exploded. From stem to stern, that kid was as naked as the day he was born, just flying through the air. Wardrobe malfunction doesn’t even start to explain it. He hits the water and we’re all hysterical.”

But the funniest part, Farr said, was that when Barrett reached the side of the pool, “He looked up at me and said, ‘Coach, let me have your swimsuit. I still think I can win this thing.”

He was uniquely curious and not easily embarrassed. “His curiosity allowed him to learn so fast,” Farr says. “He wasn’t afraid to not know, and to try things and make mistakes and figure it out.”

Barrett didn’t care if some of his passions – singing, hunting, cooking – weren’t the rage to his peers. He was driven to excel, his father says, to show himself and his friends what was possible when you did your best. And Barrett was equally driven whether he was bulking up to play football at Colorado Mesa University or losing the 90 pounds necessary to squeeze into a cockpit.

If he drew people to him, it may well have been, as his Uncle Al Bevacqua said, that “he took everybody under his wing.” And close to his heart. Until the end, Barrett was that son, brother and friend who always said, “I love you,” in parting, on the off chance that something might spin out of control before he saw you again.

Emily Hurd recovering at OHSU, surrounded by family: Haley Bevacqua; her parents, Jenny and Scott Hurd; Matt Bevacqua; Michele's sister Marta, and his parents, Giorgio and Ilenia.

Matt and Haley Bevacqua are holding fast to those words as they clean out apartments, visit Emily at the OHSU Hospital, serve as grief counselors for Barrett’s friends, or plan the scholarship that honors his memory and motivation.

“You don’t know until you live this,” Haley said, “but thus far, we’ve been amazingly strong together. We balance each other out. I fall apart when it gets quiet, and there hasn’t been too much of that. If we are both in a terrible place, we can both cry and just try to hold on.”

They hold on to this, Haley said: “Our solace is that Barrett was the happiest he’d ever been. He may have been working 14 hours a day, but he was working with his friends. He was cooking every night for his family. He was succeeding in his goals.”

And he is still changing lives.

Barrett in his element

“He had gentleness about him that’s hard to explain,” Farr said in his closing at the memorial service. “I heard one friend after the next talk about his kindness. How he welcomed them, comforted them, helped them, understood them, cooked for them, and made all of them laugh.

“So, if you catch me out there being goofy, or curious, or you catch me in a moment of kindness, and I hope you do, know that that is the Barrett in me trying to get out. That’s how I’m going to honor him. He was a gift to all of us who loved him. And he was a gift we show our gratitude for by trying to be more the person he inspired us to be.”

"'The former U.S. ambassador accused of spying for the Cuban government spent 40 years as a spook and claimed his work was “more than a grand slam.”

Victor Manuel Rocha, 73, was formally charged Monday in Miami Federal Court. Rocha was arrested on Friday, more than 20 years after his tenure as U.S. ambassador to Bolivia.

The FBI finally caught Rocha by having one of its agents pose as a contact with Cuba’s intelligence agency.

“What we have done … it’s enormous,” Rocha told the undercover agent, according to an indictment released Monday. “More than a grand slam.”

Rocha joined the State Department in 1981 and worked jobs dealing with Central and South America for the following two decades. From July 1994 to July 1995, he was director of Inter-American Affairs on the National Security Council, which gave him a direct hand in American policy on Cuba.

After that, he spent two years as deputy principal officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. His highest profile job came from 2000 to 2002, when President Bill Clinton named him ambassador to Bolivia.

During that entire time, Rocha was a Cuban spy, according to federal investigators.

“This action exposes one of the highest-reaching and longest-lasting infiltrations of the United States government by a foreign agent,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement announcing the charges against Rocha.

The FBI started its undercover operation to bust Rocha in November 2022, when the agent messaged Rocha posing as a member of Cuba’s Dirección de Inteligencia, commonly known as the DGI.

Rocha eventually agreed to three meetings with the undercover agent. Throughout the conversations, he referred to the U.S. as “the enemy.”

In referring to his own actions, Rocha told the agent, “What has been done, has strengthened the Revolution. It has strengthened it immensely.”

“They underestimated what we could do to them. We did more than they thought,” Rocha said, according to the indictment against him.

Even after he left the State Department, Rocha worked with the U.S. military from 2006 to 2012, providing advice on Central and South American strategy, including Cuba.

The feds finally showed their cards on Friday, over a year after the investigation began, according to the charging documents. Rocha denied meeting with the undercover agent or ever working for the Cuban government, but he was still arrested.

“However long it might take, we will deliver justice to those who betray their solemn oaths to the American people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Olsen said.'",sports,tennis

The annual NBA MVP award chase attracts more futures betting interest each season.

NBA MVP futures betting: 2021/2022 winner Nikola Jokic tops early favorites list (+150 or better)

The Denver Nuggets’ hyper-talented big man failed to capture a third straight league MVP award a season ago.

But Jokic still managed to come away with something even more cherished: The NBA Finals MVP trophy as the Nuggets won their first league title.

And a little more than a month into the 2023-24 season, the Serbian sensation has demonstrated that he’s doing everything but resting on his impressive list of laurels.

The league’s leading rebounder at 12.8 per game, Jokic has totaled a league-most eight triple-doubles in his first 20 contests — no one else has more than three — while topping the league’s Player Impact Estimate leaderboard with a 22.4 rating and earning the NBA Western Conference Player of the Month award for October/November.

NBA MVP futures betting: Mavericks’ Luka Doncic in running for first MVP award (+500 or better)

The do-it-all Doncic is just hitting his prime in Year 6, and that’s a rather scary thought for Dallas Mavericks opponents.

He stands second in the league in scoring with an average of 31.4 points per game and ranks fifth in assists (8.4) and 29th in rebounding (8.4).

Doncic is shooting a career-best 38.8 percent from 3-point range, and his three triple-doubles are second only to Jokic’s eight.

More Mavs team success certainly would help Doncic’s cause, as Dallas has been running just above mediocre at 11-8 and sixth place in the Western Conference through Monday.

NBA MVP futures betting: Reigning MVP Joel Embiid making case for repeat (+750 or better)

The Philadelphia 76ers’ center is showing that his 2022-23 NBA MVP award may not be his last.

Embiid is setting the league scoring pace for the third straight year with his average of 32 points per game, and he also ranks among the NBA’s top 10 in rebounding (11.3), double-doubles (12) and blocked shots (1.9).

The Sixers funnel their offense through Embiid — as evidenced by his league-leading 35.8 usage percentage — and opposing defenders have few options to slow the 7-footer as he’s the league’s lone player averaging double figures in either free throw attempts (11.8) or free throw makes (10.3).

NBA MVP futures betting: Pacers’ Haliburton, Timberwolves’ Edwards among longer shots to watch

Indiana Pacers point guard and league assists (11.9)/offensive rating (126.7) leader Tyrese Haliburton was attracting his fair of attention over the season’s first month.

But then came Monday night’s nationally-televised In-Season Tournament semifinal against the league-leading Boston Celtics, and Haliburton had a 26-point, 13-assist, 10-rebound triple-double to spark the Pacers’ 122-112 upset win.

Those are the types of performances that elevate player conversations from All-Star to MVP level. Meanwhile, the surprising Minnesota Timberwolves owned the Western Conference’s best record at 15-4.

And while Minnesota is succeeding primarily due to the league’s best team defensive rating (106.7) and a deep, underrated roster, the T’wolves’ leader (fourth-year shooting guard Anthony Edwards) in scoring (26.2), 3-pointers (2.5), steals (1.3) and assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5) is definitely deserving of inclusion in the MVP discussion.

"'Severe thunderstorms caused deadly flooding across eastern Australia over Christmas week while wildfires continue to burn in the west, fueled by a heat wave and the influence of the El Niño climate pattern.

At least 10 deaths have been associated with the chaotic weather pattern, according to local authorities.

A low-pressure system tapped into tropical air from the north, fueling humid conditions and severe thunderstorms across eastern Australia beginning on Christmas Day, causing a multi-day severe weather outbreak, according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

Severe thunderstorms continued to impact parts of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland on Tuesday, bringing hail, strong winds and intense rainfall.

""Police are continuing to respond to ongoing requests for assistance following the severe storms that affected the region earlier this week, with fallen trees, powerlines and other safety hazards continuing to be observed,"" Queensland police said in a Facebook post.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a 9-year-old girl was killed in Brisbane on Christmas during the severe weather.

Three men died after a large motorboat overturned during the storm near Green Island in Queensland on Tuesday. Eight people were rescued from the water. Queensland Police said the bodies of 48-year-old, 69-year-old and 59-year-old men were later recovered.

Also in Queensland, three women were swept away by floodwaters in Southside Gympie on Tuesday. One woman made it to safety. However, Queensland police said the bodies of 40-year-old and 46-year-old women were later found.

Reuters reports a man and woman died in flash flooding in Victoria, and two others were killed by falling trees.

Multiple marine warnings for wind and high surf were in place during the multi-day storm event.

Officials with the New South Wales Police Force said a 19-year-old man is missing after going into the water to rescue a family member caught in rough surf. The man became caught in a rip current and was swept out to sea, according to police.

Intense rainfall caused flash flooding and riverbeds to crest, with the highest 24-hour rain totals in Wedderburn, Victoria of 6 inches and Cockatoo Road, Queensland with 5.8 inches. Giant hail of nearly 2 inches was observed in New South Wales, and wind gusts topped 70 mph in parts of Queensland.

A tornado caused power outages and damages on the Gold Coast and Scenic in Queensland on Christmas, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

Thousands in New South Wales and Queensland remain without power on Wednesday, according to multiple power providers in Australia.

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecasts the continued threat of severe thunderstorms for eastern Australia on Wednesday, with relief in the stormy pattern on Thursday. Flood Warnings were in place for Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.

The storms came about a week after Tropical Cyclone Jasper caused flooding in northeast Australia, prompting hundreds of rescues by Queensland Fire and Emergency Services.

Flooding and high tides washed away roads in Holloways Beach. Local news outlets report river flooding washed crocodiles into suburban communities.

Meanwhile, drought and an early summer heat wave are fueling bushfire growth in parts of Australia. Summer in Australia began in December, but the heat has been ongoing since September when the Climate Council declared the El Niño event underway in Australia.

According to NASA's Earth Observatory data, the heatwave has been particularly brutal in Western Australia, with temperatures reaching 104 degrees, which is 18 degrees above normal for this time of year. A 21-year-old volunteer firefighter was killed Tuesday while responding to a bushfire in Esperance, reports Western Australia Today.

Australia's bushfire season typically peaks in January or February. This year, fire detections have topped the 2019-200 ""black summer"" in Australia, according to the Global Forest Watch.

This week, heat wave warnings continue across Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland.

Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas, who finished second in MVP voting, was also named to the first team, along with Las Vegas Aces forward A’ja Wilson, who finished third in MVP voting, and Dallas Wings forward Satou Sabally.

Collier, Thomas and Sabally received first-team honors for the first time, while Stewart made her fourth consecutive appearance on the team. It was Wilson’s third such honor.

Stewart, who took home her second career MVP this season in the closest vote in league history, averaged 23 points, 9.3 rebounds. 3.8 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.5 blocks per game. She led the New York Liberty to the WNBA Finals, where they won Sunday to bring their series with the Aces to 2-1 and force a Game 4.

Collier averaged 21.5 points and 8.5 rebounds per game for the Minnesota Lynx and was selected as an All-Star for the third time. Thomas put up 15.5 points, 9.9 rebounds and 7.9 assists per game and led the Connecticut Sun to the playoff semifinals.'",sports,basketball

NATIONAL CITY, Calif. — National City is working to create new housing and held a housing density workshop Thursday to discuss options.

Mayor Ron Morrison said nearly every housing unit in the city is full which puts the city's vacancy rate close to zero. With much of the city already developed, the only option is to build higher. The city also has one of the lowest homeowner rates in San Diego County.

""A lot of cities have what they call their urban reserves which is open spaces,"" Morrison said. ""Our urban reserves is the weeds behind the backstop at the little league field. There are no open spaces. up is the only way we can go.""

As many cities look to build more affordable housing, National City is needing to do the opposite.

""We have so much low-income housing here they say we're kind of out of balance on that. While other cities are being given a lot of low-income housing the numbers for us are actually for the above-moderate,"" he said.

The city is looking to construct several buildings, around four to six stories, around Highland Avenue, Fourth, Eighth, 16th and 30th Street. There are concerns parking will be negatively effected if more people move to National City.

""It's gonna get crowded. It's gonna get crowded quickly. Not all of our residents are happy about all of this because we are so crowded already but it's what the state is coming down on us with,"" he said.

The mayor says the city has about 18,000 housing units and will need to build about 5,000 more units within the next eight years. Next week the city plans to talk about how new housing will impact their climate action plan.'",sports,baseball
"'BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - After our record-breaking day of 83° this past Wednesday, temperatures have stayed consistent in the near-normal region for this time of year. We’ll continue that streak through most of this week with highs in the 60s! Dry conditions will also remain through most of our early week, before a couple of small rain chances arrive into parts of Thursday and Friday.

Near-normal temps (WBKO)

The rain chances into Thursday and Friday will come from a cold front system that will set up to the west of our region and move through later this week. Rain totals from these rain chances are not looking too great at this time. Many eastern regions in our viewing area are slipping deeper into drought conditions due to the lack of rain over the last few months. Here in Bowling Green, we’re over five inches short for the year as of now.

Eastern portions of our regions have been impacted the most by drought (WBKO)

Over half of our viewing area is under some kind of drought as of right now, and it will take a few decent precipitation events to reverse them.

"'Undeterred by wars at home, delegations from Ukraine and the Palestinian territories are active at COP28, determined to call attention not only to the environmental threats facing their homelands but also to emphasize their places in the global community.

Ukraine, attending its second COP international conference, is using its pavilion in Dubai to highlight the extensive environmental damage caused by Russia’s invasion and propose preventive measures against ecocide on a global scale.

Ruslan Strilets, Ukraine’s minister of environmental protection and natural resources, told VOA that the delegation aims not only to showcase the environmental and climate consequences of the war, but also to unite and engage the international community in achieving justice and peace.

Ukraine is committed to fighting climate change, Strilets said.

“Despite the war, Ukraine is finalizing the development of its climate architecture and consistently fulfilling its climate commitments. At COP28, we plan to gather even more partners around our country for a greener future for Ukraine and the entire world,” he said.

The Ukraine pavilion’s exposition is organized into three key blocks. One block recounts a catastrophic explosion at the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant dam in June, which flooded dozens of towns and villages and killed more than 50 people.

A second block illustrates Ukrainians’ efforts to swiftly rebuild what the war has destroyed, and the third block details the impact the war is having on the environment.

During a visit this week to the Ukrainian Pavilion, Moldova Energy Minister Victor Parlicov expressed his country’s endorsement of the COP28 Environmental Declaration and reiterated that Russia should be held responsible for the environmental harm resulting from the war.

Other visitors to the pavilion have included Slovakian President Zuzana Caputova and Keit Kasemets, first deputy minister of climate for Estonia.

In the Palestinian pavilion, Ahmed Abuthaher, director general of the West Bank-based Environment Quality Authority, told VOA his delegation is in Dubai “to tell people to look at us as humanitarians, and this conference is for human beings.”

“For climate change, we need to have easy access to the financial resources. We have water shortage and in some areas we have desertification,” he said, expressing hope for help from a Loss and Damage Fund announced on the first day of the conference.

A June 2022 report prepared by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that 78% of piped water in Gaza is unfit for human consumption.

According to the COP28 official webpage of their pavilion, the Palestinian leadership recognizes that collective efforts across sectors are crucial to the fulfillment of the conference’s climate commitments and ensuring a sustainable and resilient future.

Abuthaher emphasized the Palestinian commitment to participating in COP28 while calling for the global community to take meaningful action to address the issues faced by the Palestinian people.

The environmental damage inflicted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has been documented in several studies, including an October 2022 report from the U.N. Environment Program finding that almost 1 million hectares (3,800 square miles) of land have experienced significant impact, with 812 specific sites facing threats.

VOA reported in January that the repercussions of the war extend as far as Indian-administered Kashmir, where ornithologists have cited its contribution to a scarcity of migratory birds.

COP28 delegate Ievgeniia Kopytsia, an associate of Oxford Net Zero at the University of Oxford in the U.K., said the war is also increasing carbon emissions that are widely blamed for rising temperatures worldwide.

“On top of the local pollution caused by the warfare,” she told VOA, a significant amount of greenhouse gas has been emitted into the atmosphere “caused by the consumption of fuel for military purposes, use of munitions, fires caused by shelling, bombing and mine-laying operations, and reconstruction of the civilian infrastructure.”

In July 2022, during a head-of-states conference in Lugano, Switzerland, the Ukrainian government unveiled the initial version of its 10-year national recovery plan, outlining proposed recovery pathways for major sectors at an estimated cost of $750 billion.

Kopytsia said participation in events such as COP28 can help turn that vision into a reality.

“Engaging with the global community in climate initiatives may foster diplomatic relations and provide opportunities for assistance in conflict resolution,” she said.

The impact of conflict on the environment must be addressed not only in Ukraine and Gaza but around the world, argued Simon Chambers, the director of ACT Alliance, a global alliance of more than 145 churches and other organizations from over 120 countries that provides humanitarian aid for poor and marginalized people.

“Climate justice is possible to be achieved, as is a just transition” to cleaner sources of energy, he said to VOA, but it will require all parts of society to come together — governments, nongovernmental organizations and businesses.

“We need to put the needs of the creation, of people and the planet ahead of profit and power,” he said. “If we all act in the face of the urgency of the climate emergency, it is possible to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and to do so in a way that is just.”

"'The effects of climate change are evident across every region of the U.S., but rapid and deep reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can limit future warming, a major federal report said Tuesday.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment, developed over four years by some 500 authors and 250 contributors, documents observed and projected vulnerabilities, risks and impacts associated with climate change.

""As the world warms, the U.S. warms more,"" the Congress-mandated report said. ""Including Alaska, the continental U.S. has been warming about 60% faster than the planet as a whole since 1970.""

The report said this temperature change has driven increases in the frequency and severity of some extreme events.

For example, it said, climate change made the record-breaking Pacific Northwest heatwave of June 2021 2-4 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, and in 2017, hurricane Harvey's rainfall was estimated to be about 15% to 20% heavier than it would have been without human-caused warming.

""Climate change is already affecting people in the United States. Extreme heat was estimated to be responsible for more than 700 deaths per year between 2004 and 2018, although some estimates put heat-related mortality closer to 1,300 deaths annually,"" the report said.

In addition, natural disasters are now occurring more frequently and causing more damage. In the 1980s, the country experienced, on average, a one billion dollar weather disaster every four months. Now there is one, on average, every three weeks, the analysis showed.

In response to the report, the White House said President Joe Biden will announce more than $6 billion in new investment to make communities across the country more resilient to the impacts of climate change.

The Biden administration has set a goal of cutting U.S. emissions by 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.

Rachel Cleetus, a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the U.S. is responsible for about one-fifth of all accumulated global carbon dioxide emissions.

""As the leading contributor to historical heat-trapping emissions and the wealthiest nation, our country should be leading, not lagging, on climate action,"" she said in a statement.

On the positive side, the study found that annual U.S. emissions fell by 12% between 2005 and 2019, largely driven by changes in electricity generation.

Coal use has declined, while the use of natural gas and renewable technologies has increased, leading to a 40% drop in emissions from the electricity sector, it said.

And since 2017, the transportation sector has overtaken electricity generation as the largest emitter, the report said.

"'Anyone who spends any length of time in Montana can’t help but have a personal relationship with mountains.

Mountain philosophy is key to “Sun House,” David James Duncan‘s most recent novel and first since 1992’s acclaimed saga “The Brothers K.” This latest, which was reconfigured more than 100 times in the 16 years it took to write, is a 770-page long and winding road of a story about an “unintentional menagerie” of wounded people who form a communal cattle ranch in the fictitious Elkmoon Mountains of Montana.

See also: Sign up for our free Book Pages newsletter about bestsellers, authors and more

“Sun House,” while not easy to describe, is a true epic in which Duncan, 71, tries to encapsulate the joys and pains of being human. Characters undergo great suffering (one man is nearly beaten to death by a parking lot trash container) only to persevere and find themselves on the other side of the Elkmoons (the man recovers to become a roving preacher of a new open-hearted theology, Dumpster Catholicism).

Spanning decades, “Sun House” makes time for all this: Long quiet moments in nature, Vedic literature discussions, births, deaths, the existential and actual effects of climate disaster, billionaire comeuppance, a canine Shakespeare star, redefining the American Dream, goofy sex, Beat poetry, and unconditional love among friends, all while a river of whiskey runs through it.

Being a professional, I read “Sun House” in a month’s time. As a book lover, I wish I could’ve savored it over a full Montana change of season. Preferably in a log cabin, deep among the mountain Ponderosa pines, with a roaring fireplace and a well-stocked trout stream and rye bar at hand to aid in unlocking the full spiritual “Sun House” door. Alas, I’ll have to live vicariously through Duncan’s prose, which he kindly discussed from his home in Missoula along Rattlesnake Creek. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Q. I won’t ask “what took so long,” but I have a couple of questions about the writing process. When you first started “Sun House,” did you have an understanding that it could become such a massive undertaking with so many characters living long full lives?

Part of writing “Sun House” came out of wrestling with my despair about the planet Earth, how it continues to be chewed up by extraction industries that don’t care about the repercussions, environmental or human. A big turning point was realizing a freestanding novella I’d written could be the second ‘telling’ in the book. Titled “The One-Book-of-Poems-Long Marriage,” it’s about the brief-union-into-marital-break-up between Lorilee Shay and husband Trey Jantz who try and make it a go of it in a Colorado mountain town. It hit me that “Sun House” could be told through characters loosely based on people I’ve loved throughout my life. I’ve known so many wonderful tremendous people who try to live responsibly, to share a common decency and an environmental responsibility, that I can’t believe I live in the same country as the one I see on the nightly news.

After that breakthrough, I decided to try and give all of my characters the full five senses, including their contemplative inner lives, so hopefully, people feel like reading a book of this length comes to be like hanging out with old friends. Characters like Lorilee and Trey disappear for lengths at a time, but readers have told me they like bumping back into them. It’s a more satisfying familiarity meeting them a second time. I’m happy to hear it.

Q. “Brothers K” comes in at nearly 650 pages, did that experience give you the idea to follow the “Sun House” muse wherever it went, length be damned?

Certainly, “Brothers K” helped give me the tools, but my affinity for long novels goes all the way back to college. I studied “War and Peace” with historian Charles Le Guin (husband to the great sci-fi writer Ursula Le Guin) and felt there is something special about a long novel. When it’s skillfully done, a long novel almost adds an entire incarnation to your life – in Tolstoy’s case, like you lived in 19th-century Russia.

In the heartbreaking opening of “Sun House,” an airplane bolt breaks loose and plunges 38,000 feet, instantly killing an 8-year-old girl in Mexico, which is based on an actual freak event years ago. It’s a weird, unspeakable tragedy that begins a long journey for a group of people that will end in them surrounding, and spontaneously singing, as Lorilee dies. In many ways, she becomes the community’s consoler for family and friends mourning in the room, a bit like my mother’s hospice. I can’t read that scene out loud because I lose it every time. There are depths and experiences both reading and writing a short novel can’t match.

Q. In a span of seven months, I lost my dad to cancer, surrounded at his Montana home by three generations, and then my mom to Covid in a New Jersey hospital, just the two of us and I was in a hazmat suit. ”Sun House” resonated personally because of its combination of humanity’s best and worst, of any given individual’s life cycle of delights and horrors. Was that idea always central to the book?

Yes, because I knew I would lose massive numbers of readers if “Sun House” came off as Pollyannaish. I put my characters through hell because as you know, a lot of life is dealing with scary situations and their aftermath. There is a long passage in the book where Lorilee and her boyfriend Grady Haynes are escaping a mountain forest fire. She gets seriously injured, so he carries her down the mountain and inhales so much smoke he ends up with permanent lung damage. It’s a work of fiction, but a scenario I’ve lived through. Twice, we’ve almost lost our Montana home to wildfires – one time I didn’t evacuate, hid from the cops to water the roof and save the fort. As a writer, I wanted to be true to the hardships people endure.

Q. “Sun House” takes place in the modern era, but it’s steeped in the glacial metaphysical quality of the natural world. How did that inform the literal passage of time while working on the book?

Writing the book was a generally organic process. So if there were times when I felt my consciousness needed to evolve to complete a chapter, that I was too stupid to truly write from inside of characters wiser than me, I would move onto something less taxing and not return until I was ready. There are scenes in “Sun House” walking a tightrope between staying grounded in the natural world while giving characters experiences that can’t be accounted for with just reason and rationality. Calling something mystical sounds like a silly buzzword, but I’m not afraid of writing about events like that. I’ve had them myself.

There were also mornings when I would wake up at dawn thinking about a different project altogether, so I wouldn’t work on the book because it wasn’t on the forefront of my mind. Back before “Sun House,” I built a writing studio in Lolo Montana and had the carpenter make 12 cedar boxes for manuscripts. I separated them into literary categories and over the years, the work has grown. I have a pile of narrative essays to wrangle into a collection and a rhyming graphic novel in the realm of myth about our inability to save the salmon and steelhead in Idaho’s Columbia Snake River System. It’s also a part of why “Sun House” was such an undertaking. I should add my famous editor Michael Pietsch – who also edited David Foster Wallace’s “Infinite Jest,” so he knows from epic books – was great about it. He saw progress with each new section and gave me an unheard of ten contract extensions.

Q. Mountains are the defining metaphor in “Sun House.” Are they to be conquered on high or marinated from within?

One summer in my 20s, I spent 100 days, seven-and-a-half miles from the nearest road, in the Wallowa Mountains, often referred to as “the Alps of Oregon.” They are incredible, lots of white marble, which lights up the landscape. The footing is so good on that type of rock I could set out in any direction without a compass and track of the ridges. I stopped hardcore camping in my 30s after my daughters were born and “Brothers K ” came out, but mountain adventures like I had in the Wallowas – the idiot joy in wandering about John Muir was famous for – have been marinating ever since. Decades later, those times were essential in writing “Sun House.”

Q. Lastly, most of your characters have a heart-on-the-sleeve earnestness, but not much in the way of cynicism. And yet, you told the Washington Post you don’t have hope about the state of the world, how does that play out on the page?

I didn’t want to write anything that felt like journalism, or the comically cynical conversations I have with friends about say, Montana politics. Helena is a madhouse right now. Elected officials constantly saying and doing outrageous things, appalled that kids won a lawsuit for clean skies and breathable air. We’re all dreading the Supreme Court overturning these high school kids’ heroic stand. So it’s mocking to keep from crying. Writing “Sun House,” even with its dark moments and passages, allowed me to get away from all of the daily political ugliness that causes me to lose hope.

At my core, I am a penultimate pessimist, but an ultimate optimist. It’s entirely based on my faith in the indestructibility and immortality of the soul, the mysterious spark of life within us.'",climate,heatwave

Storylines we're following in the 2023 NFL season

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

The NFL Person of the Year: Taylor Swift isn't just the 2023 woman of the year, she's the 2023 person of the year -- or so says Forbes and Time. With the accolade comes one of Swift's most in-depth interviews to date, in which she gives insight into her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, whom she began dating long before attending her first Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium. The takeaway for football fans and Taylor Swift fans is that Swift and Kelce appear to be more than a fleeting romance. Fans should expect to see Swift in the stands at Arrowhead (and on the road) for the foreseeable future. Clearly, the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season wasn't Aaron Rodgers' move to New York or Brock Purdy's dominance, but Swift herself.

Is this the Cowboys year? If you are a Dallas Cowboys fan, every year is ""the"" year (the one where the team goes all the way to the Super Bowl), but this year the 10-3 Cowboys actually have a shot. At the end of the 2022 season, quarterback Dak Prescott promised to throw less turnovers (he led the league with 15). As of today's writing, Dak managed his interceptions to just six. With superstars like Brandin Cooks and Micah Parsons on the field, the Cowboys have never looked better. The Cowboys toppled the Philadelphia Eagles from their perch in Week 14, beating them 33-13 and taking over the NFC East. The Cowboys' year? They're certainly on the path.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different with Jackson scoring 644 rushing yards, the top for QBs in the NFL. Lamar is poised to have the best season of his career. The Ravens are 10-3 coming into Week 15 and MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already make a case to turn those MVP chants into reality.'",sports,football

"'It has happened.

As soon as the Padres made it clear to the baseball world that they would be shedding payroll in 2024, folks started to link Juan Soto to the Yankees. Even with only one year remaining until the 25-year-old superstar hits free agency, the match was obvious. Soto’s a lefty slugger, an outfielder, an absolute on-base machine, and already a standout postseason performer. The Yankees deeply disappointed on offense in 2023 and were in dire need of someone just like him — and there really is only one Soto. They threw a curveball by acquiring Alex Verdugo from the Red Sox last night, but insiders were quick to note that this would not affect the negotiations.

Sure enough, the trade talks rolled along this morning and early afternoon. The key names going to San Diego were all but finalized, and it was just a matter of working out the other details. The deal is done! Here’s Jon Morosi with the first report and Joel Sherman with the confirmation, hours later after medicals had been fully reviewed.

Juan Soto trade agreement is being finalized now, source confirms.



The deal, as @JackCurryYES and @Joelsherman1 reported, sends Soto and Trent Grisham to New York for Michael King, Drew Thorpe, Jhony Brito, Randy Vásquez, and Kyle Higashioka. @MLB @MLBNetwork — Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) December 6, 2023

The trade between the Yankees and Padres sending Juan Soto and Trent Grisham to New York is now completed. The teams to make it official some time tonight. — Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) December 7, 2023

As rumored earlier in the afternoon, the Yankees are indeed picking up another outfielder in Trent Grisham, who was due a raise to about $4.9M in arbitration. Although Grisham has slumped with the bat the past couple years, the two-time Gold Glove winner immediately becomes the best defensive center fielder on the roster, and Joel Sherman reports that he’ll likely be the primary fourth outfielder. The Yankees tend to always test their depth, so Grisham’s not a bad guy at all to have in the wings, particularly for late-game glovework.

Back to the star of the show in this trade though, Josh already outlined in his trade target article why Juan Soto is such a no-brainer move for the Yankees, even at that pitching cost. The short version is that he’s one of the best pure hitters in baseball. Soto has accomplished so much already, all before turning 25 — the same age as Aaron Judge during his Rookie of the Year breakout in 2017. In six seasons with Washington and San Diego, Soto has hit .284/.421/.524 with 148 doubles, 160 homers, a 154 wRC+, and 28.4 fWAR. He’s a three-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger, a Home Run Derby and batting title winner, plus a 2019 World Series champion with the Nationals.

That is all unreal for his age, and it’s not as though Soto slowed down in 2023. He might have taken a minute to adjust to the Padres after being acquired from DC at the previous season’s deadline (during which he still posted an excellent 131 wRC+), but in 2023, he hit a career-high 35 bombs with a .275/.410/.519 triple slash, a 155 wRC+, and 5.5 fWAR. Soto will instantly team up with Judge to give the Yankees a devastating one-two punch for opposing pitchers to battle.

I’m not going to lie about the players who were sent to San Diego. I like them all and think they could have each easily been a part of the next great Yankees team. Michael King has a sketchy elbow history but after moving from a bullpen weapon to the rotation down the stretch in 2023, he demonstrated why he deserved a shot with some nasty results. Drew Thorpe was a Top 100 prospect in MLB for a reason, and he deservingly won MiLB Pitching Prospect of the Year with his ascent from 2022 draft pick to serious talent. Kyle Higashioka is as steady as they come for backup catchers, and each of Jhony Brito and Randy Vásquez flashed the potential to be MLB bullpen contributors.

Was this a lot to give up for the possibility of only year of Soto, since he has little reason to extend with a payday on the horizon that would only make Shohei Ohtani scoff? Of course, but Judge and ace Gerrit Cole are both in their early-to-mid thirties now and not getting any younger. The Yankees simply have to take advantage of their primes and capitalize with a deep playoff run in 2024. The organization has high standards for a reason, and over half the league has at least made the World Series since the Yankees last won a pennant in 2009.

It’s now or never, and while I hope that those pitchers (and Higgy) have bright futures, New York needed legitimate help in the now. The peak George Steinbrenner years in the ‘80s offered an example of the cost of surrendering too many prospects for not enough in return, but the past decade of Hal Steinbrenner years have presented that other side of the coin. Too many guys like Clint Frazier, Deivi García, Miguel Andújar, Eduardo Núñez, and more have been held onto at the cost of improving the MLB roster when the iron was hot. Their peak talent never materialized, and they were ultimately dropped for nothing. It’s a shame, but it happens far too often with prospects.

It’s not every year that you get a chance to add a nonpareil talent like Soto. It’s a Hail Mary move for 2024, and one the Yankees had to make. Let the games begin.

"'According to posts on X/Twitter by Shaun Lintern, health editor of the Sunday Times, the outage was caused by a ""serious power failure"" in the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system.

The power outage brought down the hospital's IT systems and WiFi trust-wide and impacted the blood transfusion system, significantly slowing treatment and surgery.

The power was back on at the Hospital by 4:00 pm, October 31, having begun at 8:00 am that morning.

“During this time we reverted to our standard offline processes and acknowledge that there may have been delays as a result of working in this way and we apologize for any inconvenience caused,"" said the NUH.

“Patient safety is always our top priority, and we would like to thank colleagues for their continued efforts and swift response to help rectify the problem. We can confirm that no elective surgeries were canceled or delayed as a result of this outage.”

IT outages in hospitals are not a rarity and are caused by various issues. In the UK in 2022, London-based Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust suffered a significant outage during the heatwave leaving doctors unable to access patient medical records, and ultimately costing the NHS around £1.4m ($1.7m).

“The Sunday Morning Bray”, by Bray! These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

John 16:33 (King James Version) The latest version of the Forestry Management Plan is a complete disaster for the forests due to it either ignoring or negligently ignoring the two main reasons for the plan to exist. The plan completely ignores the fact the Spotted Owl is becoming extinct due to predators rather than Old Growth Forest reductions and it has no mention of forest fires in any of its modeling which is the main reason the forests are being destroyed. It appears the plan was designed by politicians who wanted to gain favor from their friends and family by worshiping the forests rather than managing them. It fails to mention the Spotted Owl is being hunted and killed by the Barred Owl which migrated from the Midwest to the West Coast and is a very aggressive predator which is killing the Spotted owl to gain territory and a food source. The Forest Service has proposed to hire Barred Owl bounty hunters to shoot the ballooning numbers of Barred owls to protect the Spotted Owl. The Federal Forest Service wants to kill over 500,000 Barred Owls in an attempt to save their beloved Spotted Owl. Not only is the Forest Service trying to pick and choose species in the forest they are attempting an impossible tactic to hunt these owls in the forests against impossible odds. Who are they going to hire to do their dirty work, out of work loggers who were put out of work by the fake Spotted Owl studies? How are these hunters going to be able to hunt a bird which has the perfect camouflage method in the middle of the forests at night? The same people who want to kick the loggers and hunters out of the forests are going to try to train hunters to hunt a small night owl in a tangle of trees. There is no possible way they can make a significant difference in the deaths of Spotted Owls using this hope and prayer bounty program. The Spotted Owl is being hunted into extinction by a predator and no matter how much anyone wishes it will not happen these owls are going to continue to be hunted for territorial and feeding reasons. This is exactly what Darwin’s theory explained about survival of the fittest. The logger has no effect on whether these owls live or die although he plan pretends the logger is the sole reason of their extinction and being punished the most.

The second mistake in the plan is the complete dismissal of massive forest fires spreading across Oregon forests.

These forests are being destroyed by the Forest Service by not properly managing them. Rather than thinning, harvesting, and rotating forests as been done in the past this plan calls for the continued killing of the forests by mismanaging them to the point of being overgrown thickets waiting for a spark to turn into a massive furnace scorching everything in its path. The tree worshipers believe chainsaw bad, forest fires good and is the way they think over the past forty years. They would rather have a 500 square mile forest fire than to have a single tree cut down by a chainsaw. It sounds virtuous if you do not care about results but is just the opposite of how you take care of a forest. If you care about clean air and water then you need to make the forests as healthy as possible to produce the most oxygen and water filtering/water holding roots possible. Any other outcome is a failure. A medium to large forest fire will produce more CO2 and actual pollutants than a years’ worth of car emissions in Oregon, Washington, and California. You would think the Forest plan would call for the properly managed forests with young vibrant trees resistant to fire and producing as much oxygen as possible, but this plan does just the opposite and is a death sentence to the forests. This plan ignores these two facts and blames every forest issue on the Climate Change umbrella. The assumed draught will cause all sorts of catastrophes and is being used as an excuse to close the forests down to protect them when it will do just the opposite. The past two years have been fire free due to the fact these have been the wettest and coldest years on the West Coast in the past twenty years. They were the shortest summers with only a couple days over a hundred and snowpacks over 50 feet all the way down to California closing down ski resorts due to too much snow which came early and left late. Without addressing the Spotted Owl inevitability or the forest fire destruction of the Oregon resources this plan is not worth the paper it is written on. Unfortunately, the implementation of this program will cost the state billions if not trillions of dollars in lost revenue and dead trees as well as poorer quality air and water. This plan is definition of penny wise and pound foolish. This is exactly what happens when you worship the trees rather than managing them properly. This is what happens when man creates a religion which worships God’s creation rather than the Creator of the universe. This is the problem with forty years of the DNC in firm control of your forests and state. They have lied about the Spotted Owl from the beginning and have now been exposed so they are doing whatever they can to keep the lie alive by massacring another owl to protect their politically weaponized owl. Pray for Oregon Note: The above opinion is not necessarily my own, but FReeper Bray’s. If you wish to discuss this, please ping Bray.

Spotted Owl Fricassee

Ingredients

• 2 whole plucked and washed Spotted Owls

• 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste

• 1 tablespoon vegetable oil

• 2 cups thickly sliced fresh mushrooms

• 1 cup diced yellow onion

• ½ cup sliced shallots (Optional)

• 2 cloves garlic, minced

• ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

• 1 pinch cayenne

• 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour

• 1 ½ cups white wine

• 6 sprigs thyme

• 1 cup chicken broth

• ½ cup heavy cream

Directions

1. Season the owls with salt on both sides.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and place Spotted Owls skin-side-down into the hot oil. Cook until there is a good sear and fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until seared as well, about 2 minutes. Set aside.

3. Leave 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat in the pan and add sliced mushrooms. Cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Add onion, shallots, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with pepper and cayenne and stir in flour to thicken the mixture, about 1 minute.

4. Pour in white wine and cook, stirring, until alcohol has evaporated. Raise the heat to high and keep cooking until sauce has reduced to half, 3 to 5 minutes.

5. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-lo and add chicken and any accumulated juices back into the skillet, skin side up. Cover and simmer gently for 45 minutes, turning over thighs halfway through.

6. Remove lid and turn thighs back to skin side up. Continue to simmer uncovered, basting occasionally, until chicken is tender and sauce reduces even more. If the pan gets dry before the chicken is tender, add some more water or broth.

7. Add cream and simmer until sauce reaches desired thickness. Heat can be raised to medium to reduce cream faster if the owls ares already tender. Sauce can be served thin and runny, or reduced to a thick sauce. Sprinkle with fresh thyme and serve.

Excellent piece your liberal govt. at work. When something does not work employ more of what didn't work in the beginning: Namely more BIG GOVERNMENT!! ........................ Here in the Keys/entire state of Florida, we have a similar problem. We have a fish called the Jewfish(aka Goliath Grouper). see photo: About 15 years ago idiot spearfishermen took advantage of this lethargic fish and began spearing it to extinction. The obvious solution was to eliminate spearguns on this and maybe a few other fish as long as necessary.A zero bag limit could have been employed for a while until the species recovered which might have taken a few years maybe five or more. Instead the powers that be went hog/govt. reg. wild and closed off Jewfish(the name at the time) basically until a few liberal journalists decided it was time to allow some form of harvest.(still to be decided today almost 20 years later.) What happened now that the jewfish was totally protected is that it quickly became an apex predator.Not many and few creatures could harm the jewfish which was a great idea for a few years as it recovered its numbers. Today the jewfish/Goliath Grouper is a true apex predator. It preys on everything on Gulfside wrecks in the gulf of Mexico (GOM)and now is a huge player on the Atlantic side of the keys and heading north on both sides of Florida. On GOM wrecks juvenile grouper which are bag and size limit protected from fishing are constant targets as are juvenile crawfish which are also bag and size limit protected and time of year from fishermen.That works. Nowadays Jewfish eat them at will. Perhaps the worst problem is almost any fish hooked by fishermen can expect to be eaten by the Jewfish. It's out of control and as long as the crazed environmentals are in control will stay that way. Today the jewfish is protected at the expense of dozens of other species: It's the big government way. If that wasn't bad enough enter an expanding near shore shark population. It's bad enough fishermen have to try and find places where there are no or few jewfish. Over the past few years shark populations have expanded so bad that most gamefish are now in desperate situations not seen in the past. Historically, sportfishermen like myself have paid much homage to periodicals like the Florida Sportman magazine and others like it. This magazine in particular had become a bible for sportfishermen who over the years became much more CPR inclined than catch and kill. CPR in fishermens lingo stands for: Catch- Photograph- and Release. We have learned how to take great photos of gamefish like snook, tarpon,bonefish, permit, sailfish,etc. so we can protect their numbers for anglers in the future. Basically, we all wanted our sons and daughters to enjoy what we enjoy or used to now on the water. Modern sport fishermen are the conservationists of the 21st century and we come down hard on those who dare kill our gamefish. It's just good common sense. We still hate liberals!! So what has happened for the past few years is that near shore shark populations have expanded to the point where if we can escape the ravages of jewfish at one fishing spot we usually can't escape the sharks at another. In many spots both in Florida Bay and offshore gamefish like those reported along with snappers and other fish sharks eat them when hooked them or after being released in good shape. I have interviewed over 1,000 fishermen and have found the problem is now state wide and little if anything is being done to solve it. These fish,tarpon in particular,can live 70 years if treated properly by fishermen. Here in the photo below a fly fisherman releases one in good shape: Shark infestation is taking a huge toll on tarpon and other valued gamefish: We need a legislative push to kill off near shore sharks and sell them for food or worst case give their meat away to those in need. that's what we would like to see,however many fishermen likely wont stand for the slaughter of prized gamefish we have worked so hard to save for decades. The problem will be solved. Likely not by govt. Over the next few years since many of us won't allow govt. in-action to drive us out of business. Or, in many cases,depriving us of what we work for all week. Shark populations have to decline. Our goals are: to go fishing,catch gamefish and release them in good shape. No one will stop us from doing that. Big liberal govt. never works.

He's hated everywhere by everyone. Cory Mills of Fla. saying Biden can't win. Lying Jared Bernstein who can turn any stats into looking good for the libs now on with Mike Emmanuel. Bernstein is head of council of economic advisers. He's gonna say how well everything is and how wonderful it will be with the dirty dems in office. Bernstein says the problems will be solved by lowering costs,what a putz! Problem is 20,000 illegals coming across the border 7% interest and all the rest that Bernstein will never talk about. Bernstein says we have continual budget deficit reduction,can you lie any better than that? What a lying POS he has an excuse for everything. ....................... Next the panel with Mariel Hemingway and three libs. Julia Manchester from the hill says biden is vulnerable,duhhhh...... no sh-t sherlock.

Communists have found a club to beat capitalists using the endangered species act. The could not care less about the species and everything about closing down freedom. The Spotted owl would not be endangered if the forests were managed properly rather than shut down. They have found larger numbers in second growth forests than old growth but they still promote the myth of old growth only.

tOSU hired a novice to be head coach at suggestiuon/demand of Urban Meyer. Ryan Day had never been a head coach. He came from a Division 1-A school (U of New Hampshire), played QB. His incompetence has always been obvious. Jim Harbaugh deemed him “born on third base and thought he’d hit a triple”. Lou Holtz (a former OSU assistant when they won National Title under Woody, called Day’s teams “Soft”. Big Uproar. But the fact is Day is a Beta male, stubborn, insists on calling plays (that do not work), will not replace bad coaches, and can’t even cajole his players to PLAY in Bowl games which are not for all the marbles. He recruits one-and-done types who have no loyalty to Ohio or tOSU except for how much NIL money they can glean. I hope that partially outlines the problem/issue. GO BUCKS! And Roll Tide! (whose coach Nick Saban learned smash-mouth football under Woody’s heir Earle Bruce at tOSU)

"'Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is inactive for the team's Week 15 game against the New York Jets, the team announced on Sunday (December 17).

Hill suffered an ankle injury early in the Dolphins' 'Monday Night Football' loss to the Tennessee Titans, which he eventually played through late after missing considerable time. The 29-year-old sat out for all of Miami's practices leading up to Sunday's game.

The Dolphins were reportedly giving Hill the option to determine if he would be able to play in Week 15, sources with knowledge of the situation told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Saturday (December 16), but the decision was anticipated to be made during pregame warmups, as eventually became the case.'",sports,football
"'CNN —

Offshore storms shoved waves toward communities along the California coast, bringing flooding and road closures, as well as fright to nearly 20 people who were briefly swept away along a Ventura beach on Thursday. Eight people were taken to the hospital, officials said.

The swells will not be a one-day thing: Some areas of the California coast will see towering waves – some up to 30 feet – through the weekend. The waves will usher high water and rip currents. Coastal flood alerts and high-surf alerts stretch from the US-Mexico border to north of the Bay Area.

Waves, coupled with high tides, sent torrents of seawater into Santa Cruz along the central coast.

The Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office issued an evacuation warning for some areas. The evacuation warning covered an unincorporated area of the county near Seacliff State Beach and Rio Del Mar, according to a post on the department’s Facebook page.

California Highway Patrol Santa Cruz warned of coastal flooding at the Rio Del Mar Esplanade in a post on X and urged people to avoid the area.

“Rio Del Mar Esplanade is currently flooded. Please avoid the area and do not attempt to drive across flooded areas. Road closures are in effect, so please do not drive around them. Drive with caution and prioritize safety,” it wrote.

Five campers were evacuated along the San Luis Obispo coast Thursday, officials detailed in a social media post.

The spectacular waves drew surfers and onlookers, who gawked at nature’s power.

Just northwest of Los Angeles, 15 to 20 onlookers were briefly swept away after a large wave overtook a beach barrier in a Ventura neighborhood hit by high surf, police Cmdr. Ryan Weeks told CNN.

The onlookers were washed down the street about 30 to 50 yards, Weeks said.

Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals. Currently the beaches are closed in Ventura County… pic.twitter.com/VlRlgRLhpn — VCFD PIO (@VCFD_PIO) December 29, 2023

The county fire department posted a video of the rogue wave and the ensuing chaos on X, noting the beaches are currently closed in the county. “Because of this wave eight people were transported to local hospitals,” the agency said.

Streets in the area were closed as a precaution, as was a main access point to the Ventura Pier to encourage people to stay away.

“We’re trying to keep people off the beach to keep them from getting hit by rogue waves,” Weeks said.

Aerial video from CNN affiliate KABC showed the aftermath, as residents in the area tried to clean up the foamy, sandy mess.

The flooding comes as the Southern California coast was being impacted by large swells, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said in a social media post.

Dangerous surf, life-threatening rip currents, and coastal flooding are expected at the beaches this week. Impacts are expected to become most extreme on Thursday. #CAwx pic.twitter.com/Nr0JOdwRZ8 — NWS Los Angeles (@NWSLosAngeles) December 27, 2023

One swell reached about 20 feet at Ventura Pier, the agency added.

“Dangerous surf, life-threatening rip currents, and coastal flooding are expected at the beaches this week. Impacts are expected to become most extreme on Thursday,” weather service posted.

The most significant impacts are expected along the central and Ventura County coasts, along with Hermosa, Manhattan and Palos Verdes beaches, according to the agency.

Fifteen to 20-foot waves are expected in the central coast, bringing potentially damaging coastal flooding.

“Beach conditions becoming extremely dangerous Thursday morning continuing through the weekend,” the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said in its forecast.

Officials recommend beachgoers stay out of the water due to dangerous surf conditions and potentially life-threatening rip currents. Beach erosion also is possible.

“Prepare for significant sea water flooding, especially in low-lying areas (including beaches/harbors) & at high tide,” the weather service said.

In Ocean Beach, near San Diego, the curious and surfers thronged to the beach to take it all in, according to CNN affiliate KGTV.

Not everyone who brought a board got into the roiling surf.

“My friend asked me if I wanted to come check it out, and once I saw it, I knew it was too large and in charge for me,” Gerry Giuliano told the affiliate. “I mean, it’s hitting the pier and that’s a warning sign that it’s pretty big, closing out and breaking pretty quickly, too.”

Northern California is expected to have its own share of problems.

The Bay Area is under a coastal flood warning until 6 p.m. Thursday, with significant coastal flooding expected through the evening hours before conditions begin to improve.

A high-surf warning is in effect in the Bay Area until 3 a.m. Friday.

“Dangerously large breaking waves of 28 to 33 ft with up to 40 ft possible at favored locations,” the weather service said. The agency said San Francisco, Monterey Bay, Point Reyes and Big Sur are among the affected areas.

The Bay Area National Weather Service office said a coastal flood advisory is in effect through 2 p.m. Friday for the combination of high surf and potential storm surge. The advisory stretches from west of Cloverdale south to Big Sur.

An evacuation order was issued for a portion of Marin County near San Francisco but it was later lifted.

A deadly storm slammed the California coast in January 2023.

"'The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation released the updated version of Montana Drought Management Plan. The last state drought plan was released in 1995 – a lot has changed in that time.

“We’ve just been having hotter, drier conditions in Montana,” said Cori Hach, the Montana DNRC Water Planning, Implementation, and Communications Bureau Chief. “It’s a really great time to evaluate the menu of options that we have to continue to build drought resistance.”

The updated plan adds newer ways that THE U.S. assess droughts, how locations get federal aid when dealing with a drought and who to contact during times of drought.

“It’s kind of the first time that it’s been kind of documented in daylight for anyone to understand exactly how that process happens,” Hach said.

The plan covers how to improve drought preparedness, including prevention and recovery.

The importance of understanding how areas are affected during each season.

It also addresses vulnerabilities across five water sectors throughout the state and stakeholder-generated recommendations for resources.

Hach says that a lot of drought management happens at the local level. The new plan aims to guide local control during droughts.

“And some of the recommendations would help the state get out of local community’s way as they try to implement recommendations,” Hach said.

"'Drought conditions across Upcountry Maui have prompted the county to update its water shortage status for the unforeseeable future.

The Upcountry water service area covers Makawao, Kula, Haʻikū, Pukalani, Kokomo, ʻUlumalu, ʻUlupalakua and Kanaio.

Water users are asked to stop watering plants and lawns, washing vehicles, and other nonessential activities. County officials said residents in violation could face a fine.

Demand for water in the area currently exceeds supply by 20% — which moves the water shortage status from Stage 1 to Stage 2, county officials said Thursday.

The Department of Water Supply cited the lack of rainfall and low surface water flow as the main causes. Stage 2 occurs when officials expect water demand to exceed available water supply by 16 to 30%.

“The purpose of the storage reservoirs was to carry us from wet season to wet season, however, since this wet season is expected to be below average, action is needed,"" Water Supply Director John Stufflebean said in a press release.

The county has been in a Stage 1 water shortage since Oct. 26. The updated status will go into effect on Wednesday, Nov. 8.

Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast less rainfall through April 2024.'",climate,drought
"'Taylor Swift has returned to the stage following an emotional weekend in Rio de Janeiro.

The 33-year-old singer performed the second of three shows in Brazil on Sunday night (November 19) at Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium in Rio.

Taylor performed her first show of the weekend on Friday in the middle of a heatwave and a fan tragically passed away at the stadium before the show even began. Saturday’s show was canceled at the last minute due to the heatwave and the show was postponed until Monday night.

When Taylor was ready to hit the stage on Sunday night, it was pouring rain.

Keep reading to find out what Taylor Swift told the crowd…

Taylor asked the crowd, “How lucky do you have to be to have 65,000 people dance in the pouring rain with you? I’ve never gotten to bring a tour to Brazil before and you’ve been so supportive to me ever since the beginning of my career. I love you so much and I’m so happy to see your faces tonight you have no idea.”

When it came time for the Folklore set, Taylor joked about getting a reprieve from the rain while inside the cabin.

“The only place you can escape the rain in this entire stadium is in the folklore cabin,” she told fans from the stage.

Temperatures have dropped in Rio thanks to the rain, but fans were concerned about Taylor performing again after seeing how she had difficulty breathing at Friday’s show.'",climate,heatwave
"''Waukesha Strong' streaming on Peacock shares the life and legacy of Jackson Sparks

WAUKESHA, Wis. (CBS 58) -- The life and legacy of Jackson Sparks hit a worldwide stage on Friday, Dec. 15.

A new documentary called ""Waukesha Strong"" is now streaming on Peacock.

In association with the WWE, it details wrestling superstar and Wisconsin native Braun Strowman honoring Jackson in many ways.

Strowman was Jackson's favorite wrestler and a hero of his, and since the Waukesha parade attack, which claimed the lived of six people, including eight-year-old Jackson Sparks, Strowman has grown a relationship with the Sparks' family.

He invited Sheri, Aaron, and Tucker Sparks to a WWE event in Green Bay. He showed up at the Jackson Sparks Home Run Derby and continues to support the Sparks family and the Jackson Sparks Foundation.

As you can imagine for the Sparks, watching the movie about their little boy who is no longer here, but absolutely adored Braun Strowman, brings up a lot of emotions.

CBS 58 will have much more next week from our exclusive interview with the Sparks family, as we dive deeper into what this all means to them, and for Jackson's legacy.'",sports,baseball

"'We penned a note in August titled, Is It Time To Fact-Check Corporate Media's 'Climate Hysteria' Over ""Hottest Day Ever?""

Climate alarmists in corporate media pushed a disinformation campaign with sketchy climate math this past summer that even the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had to run away from.

Remember the climate doom headlines in corporate media?

By late summer, 1,609 scientists and professionals worldwide had signed a declaration, including 321 from the United States, dismissing the existence of a climate crisis and insisting that carbon dioxide benefits Earth, contrary to the popular alarmist narrative.

Also, remember this idiot child making climate doom prophesies...

The latest data from the National Interagency Fire Center reveals wildfire burn acreage across the US is the lowest in decades.

Climate change contrarian Tony Heller was the first to point out this inconvenient truth, indicating on social media platform X, ""Burn acreage in the US this year was the lowest of the century. This will not be reported by the @nytimes , @CNN or @NPR - because it doesn't suit their #ClimateScam agenda.""

Heller also pointed out this data in July.

US forest fire burn acreage through July 7 is at historic lows and less than one-third of the ten year average. You will not hear this reported by @NPR or the @nytimes #ClimateScamhttps://t.co/4A3JpCSyzt pic.twitter.com/XJIO91FbIk — Tony Heller (@TonyClimate) July 9, 2023

Meanwhile, corporate media and their billionaire pals want to ban cow farts and fossil fuel cars for the masses while they enjoy a life of luxury.

"'By David Mullens

It took 52 years in Texas and 62 years as a franchise for the Texas Rangers to finally earn a seat at the table reserved for local champions. But before becoming the unlikely 2023 World Series Champions, the Rangers had plenty of stories to share.

When Mark Cuban bought the Dallas Mavericks in 2000, there was a sense that eventually the team would win an NBA Championship. In 2011, despite finishing the regular season in third place in the Western Conference, Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, Jason “Jet” Terry and Tyson Chandler led the Mavs over LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and the Miami Heat to win the NBA Finals. It is the Mavericks only NBA title.

When the Dallas Stars won the Stanley Cup in 1999, they were too good to fail. They blistered the competition, winning their second consecutive President’s Trophy for best regular season record. They had Mike Modano, Brett Hull, Joe Nieuwendyk, Derian Hatcher, Guy Carbonneau, Jamie Langenbrunner, Jere Lehtinen, Mike Keane, Darryl Sydor, Pat Verbeek, Sergei Zubov and Ed Belfour. It is the Stars only NHL title.

When the 1990s Dallas Cowboys won three World Championships, they were expected to win. They had Hall of Famers Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, Michael Irvin and head coach Jimmy Johnson. The only question was if new head coach Barry Switzer could lead the 1995 team to a third Super Bowl victory after owner Jerry Jones had replaced Johnson, winning a clash of egos. Switzer proved that he could, even if the owner appeared to rip the Vince Lombardi Super Bowl trophy from Switzer’s hands in the postgame celebration as if Jones had won a bet. It was the last Cowboys NFL title.

Based on their past, nothing was expected of the 2023 Texas Rangers. But after a 162-game regular season that saw an eight-game winning streak and an eight-game losing streak, the Rangers became magically consistent in the playoffs. They beat the AL’s three best teams and won a record 11 playoff road games in route to the World Championship. It is the Rangers’ first MLB title.

The Rangers have finally joined the other three local champions. It seemed they might never make it.

After 11 seasons, the Washington Senators moved to Arlington in 1972 and played in Arlington Stadium located between Dallas and Fort Worth. The stadium was built in 1965 with a capacity of 10,000 and was home to the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs (formerly the Fort Worth Cats). It was initially called Turnpike Stadium, named for a highway. Imagine the New York Yankees playing at Major Deegan Expressway Stadium.

Throughout time, Arlington Stadium — home of the Rangers until 1993 — eventually expanded to more than 42,500 seats with more than half located in the baking heat of the unprotected bleachers. The stadium was never home to a championship of any kind, even a division title. In the shadows of the amusement park Six Flags over Texas, Arlington Stadium became the brunt of a joke. It was known as “No Flags over Texas.”

But the stadium evokes memories. On Tuesday, Aug. 22, 1989, with a 7:35 p.m. start and a game time temperature of 95 degrees, 42,869 fans watched Nolan Ryan strike out Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson for his 5,000th career strikeout. Ryan, 42, would throw a 135-pitch complete game, scatter five hits with 13 strikeouts and still lose 2-0 to the Oakland A’s. Ryan would toss two of his seven no hitters as a Ranger.

Rangers’ rookie centerfielder Oddibe McDowell hit for the cycle there in 1985. For good measure, McDowell — after a double, triple, single and home run — hit a second home run in the eighth inning in an 8-4 win over the Cleveland Indians behind knuckleballer and noted chain smoker Charlie Hough. I remember because I sweated through both games.

McDowell epitomized the early Rangers. He was a can’t-miss prospect. Texas used their first-round pick in the 1984 Major League Baseball draft (12th overall) to select McDowell, leaving pitchers Norm Charlton, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Al Leiter and Houston Astros All-Star third baseman Ken Caminiti on the board. In five seasons in Texas, McDowell hit .251 with 57 HRs and 195 RBI. Remember, in 1998, the Rangers made shortstop Scott Fletcher DFW’s first $1 million athlete in any sport.

The Rangers lore wasn’t just achieved at home. Right Fielder Jose Canseco had a ball hit off his head and go into the right field bleachers at Cleveland Municipal Stadium for a home run. In 2000, Scott Sheldon defined the term “utility player” when he played all nine positions in a 13-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox. With all due respect to Ryan, Sheldon may be the greatest pitcher in Rangers’ history. He faced one batter and struck him out. His lifetime ERA is 0.00.

Moving next door to the Ballpark in Arlington (later Globe Life Park), the Rangers were deemed division champions despite a losing record in the 1994 strike season. The playoffs were canceled. In 1996, 1998 and 1999, the Rangers would win legitimate Western Division crowns, only to amass a collective ALDS record of 1-9.

There were moments at the Ballpark. Kenny Rodgers pitched a perfect game. Gary Matthews Jr. made the catch of the century over the centerfield wall. In 2003, Boston’s Bill Mueller hit a grand slam from both sides of the plate in consecutive at bats. The Rangers beat the Yankees in the 2011 ALCS.

I sat one seat away from former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani.

And the Ballpark hosted an All-Star Game in 1995 and the World Series in 2010 and 2011. The AL lost the All-Star Game and the Rangers lost both World Series.

Now Globe Life Field can claim two World Series Champions: the 2023 Texas Rangers and the 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers, forced to play in Arlington because of the pandemic. Former Dodgers and current Rangers’ shortstop Corey Seager was MVP of both World Series.

With the Rangers winning the 2023 World Series, Texas has been invited to join the Dallas sports team’s table of champions. They earned it. But they have always been the life of the party.'",sports,baseball
"'With just two more sleeps until Christmas, the weather bureau is tipping mild weather for most of the country.

After the recent heatwave in the eastern states and flooding in the north, afternoon showers and thunderstorms are likely across Queensland, including Brisbane.

In New South Wales (NSW), there will be onshore winds and cloudy skies, with some showers likely in Sydney and elsewhere.

In Victoria and Tasmania, southeasterly winds are forecast to bring cloud and cooler-than-average temperatures, with morning showers ahead of clearing conditions in the afternoon for Melbourne and Hobart.

Adelaide can expect some sunshine, after a cool and cloudy start for Christmas morning over South Australia.

In Western Australia, a low-pressure system has been brewing this week and could bring showers and storms to the interior as well as Perth, interspersed with sunshine.

The Northern Territory can expect seasonal afternoon showers and storms around Darwin, although the risk of any Christmas impacts due to the remnants of ex-tropical cyclone Jasper appears unlikely, the Bureau of Meteorology said. TEMPERATURE RANGES FOR CAPITAL CITIES ON THE DAY:

* Sydney: 19-29 degrees Celcius

* Canberra: 13-24 degrees Celcius

* Melbourne: 16-23 degrees Celcius

* Brisbane: 22-33 degrees Celcius

* Hobart: 14-21 degrees Celcius

* Adelaide: 13-21 degrees Celcius

* Perth: 21-33 degrees Celcius

* Darwin: 28-35 degrees Celcius

Meanwhile, fish markets are gearing up for a final push as Australians shop for one of the most popular fares for the Christmas table—seafood.

The Sydney Fish Market, one of the biggest in Australia, is open from 5am Dec. 23 to 5pm on Christmas Eve and expects to sell more than 350 tonnes, including 120 tonnes of prawns and about 70,000 dozen oysters.

More than 100,000 people are expected to visit the market in the inner city suburb of Pyrmont in the next 36 hours.

The most popular items are usually barramundi, snapper, lobsters, and of course prawns and oysters.

There are also “affordably delicious” fish like school whiting, gurnard, and ocean jacket.

“We encourage visitors to come with an open mind and menu, and let our expert retailers guide you towards the catch of the day,” market chief executive Greg Dyer said.'",climate,forest fire

Fire-weakened trees and other debris on and along the parkway were removed, and traffic is now able to safely pass through.

With Tuesday’s rain, drivers are urged to proceed carefully, especially at higher elevations as the roadway may be icy at times.

Forest Service officials said there were two inches of rain that came down Tuesday, helping to reduce wildfire activity.

We’re told two inches of rain is equivalent to about 600 million gallons of water across the fire area. The 600 million gallons of water is about the same as 200,000 air tanker drops or two million Type 6 engine water tanks used on the fire, officials said.

"'Prescribed burn update for October 12

Mammoth Lakes, Calif., October 12, 2023 – Throughout this week, wildland firefighters have worked to hold the 332 acres completed on the “Pit” and “Smoke” prescribed fire units on the Mammoth Ranger District. Tomorrow, October 13, they plan to burn an additional 110 acres on the “Smoke” unit. This prescribed fire will be extremely visible alongside Highway 395 North, with the smoke plume showing from far distances up and down the valley.

Since Sunday, strong winds out of the north up to 35 mph tested the burn units, especially on Tuesday night where an engine was sent out to patrol it overnight; however all units held within containment lines. Tomorrow, winds will be much more favorable and back out of the southwest, the same winds as October 3-9. These southwest winds tomorrow are predicted to push smoke to the northeast from 5-10 mph. Saturday, winds are also predicted to behave the same, but on Sunday the winds will be even lighter and out of the southeast.

All of the same firefighting resources will be present to conduct this burn until Monday, then when resources return to their home units the Inyo National Forest firefighters will take over holding the completed units until they are declared out.

Updates will be posted on the Inyo National Forest Facebook page and on our website.

Inyo National Forest fire management staff want to take a moment to thank our assisting resources, who have made this important work possible in reducing fuels and restoring forest health on the Inyo:

"'OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Health experts at the University of Nebraska Medical Center are sounding the alarm about how drought affects health.

Though the Omaha metro area and surrounding areas have had more rain recently, parts of Nebraska and Iowa are still in severe drought.

Researchers with UNMC say drought is one of the deadliest climate-related disasters in the U.S., and it’s also the most overlooked.

On Monday, they presented findings from more than three years of research into water, climate, and health. They say while the impact of disasters like floods or hurricanes is obvious right away, the effects of drought evolve over time.

Researchers say Nebraska and Iowa are trending wetter overall. However, models predict that summers will continue to get drier. That would have a big impact on agriculture.

As for health, researchers say drought can cause respiratory, allergy, and mental health issues. By occupation, farmers have one of the highest suicide rates, due in part to stress brought on by drought.

Research also shows drought affects the health of women more than men. Figuring out the cause is the next step. Researchers say it could be linked to underlying health conditions that are more common in women.

Doctor Jesse E. Bell with U.N. M.C. says finding answers now will help in the future.

“If we can better understand how droughts are impacting our environment now, what that means for human health outcomes, then we can make that next step that we have more resilient, better-prepared communities do deal with drought in the future,” Bell said.

Bell said the next steps include more research, and putting together a handbook for health professionals about how to talk about drought and health and what messages they need to get across.

"'Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr announced Wednesday that three men were facing a combined 52-count indictment resulting from a state anti-gang operation.

Operation Heatwave, which was underway for 16 weeks, led to 96 arrests, according to the AG’s office.

Through the effort, 62 guns were recovered and 41 suspected gang members were apprehended, officials said.

Now, three of the 96 defendants face an indictment in Fulton County court. Carr’s office said they faced charges for drug trafficking and weapons offenses.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

Carr’s office said the three individuals indicted were alleged to have participated in criminal gang activity while associated with the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips.

“Chiquille Bell, Contrellis Books, and Marcus Thornton with Violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, Trafficking Oxycodone, Possession with Intent to Distribute Amphetamine, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and other drug and weapons offenses,” the AG’s office said in the announcement.

The AG’s office continued, saying the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips were a “traditional street gang based in Los Angeles, California.”

TRENDING STORIES:

“This indictment is further proof of the results we’re able to achieve when all levels of law enforcement come together to do one thing – protect the people of our state,” Carr said. “With Operation Heatwave, we continue to see meaningful outcomes that ultimately lead to safer streets and safer communities, and we’re proud to be a part of this effort alongside our partners at APD. When it comes to violent crime and gang activity, we will not look the other way, and those responsible will be held accountable.”

Bell, Books and Thornton were indicted after the AG’s office presented evidence to a Fulton County Grand Jury on Aug. 31.

Prosecutors from the Attorney General’s Gang Prosecution Unit will handle the case, according to the AG’s office.

The defendants named in the indictment face the following charges.

Chiquille Bell (aka Santana), 28, of Atlanta:

Since its creation in July 2022, the Gang Prosecution Unit has indicted 89 alleged gang members across Georgia.

Operation Heatwave, according to Carr’s announcement, reduced violent crimes in the st ate by as much as 40%, depending on the crime in question.

In the city of Atlanta, the AG said crime was down 21%, with homicide down 26%, aggravated assaults down 21%, and robberies down 19%.

“The Operation Heatwave detail is a partnership that spans our federal, state, and local partners, focused on attacking gangs, guns and drugs,” Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. “Operation Heatwave is an intelligence-driven initiative that is successful because we identify which individuals are likely to commit violent crimes in our city. Data allows us to identify what areas of the city are prone to violence. Our key partnerships, coupled with the hard work from our sworn and civilian personnel, is how we go after the gangs, guns, and drugs that drive violent crime and how we are able to protect the residents, visitors and stakeholders of the city and the county.”

Across the state, the multi-agency operation has reportedly reduced homicides by 24%, aggravated assaults by 11%, and robberies by 40%, according to Carr’s office.

Solar and wind power may be free, renewable fuels, but they also depend on natural processes that humans cannot control. It's one thing to acknowledge the risks that come with renewable energy: the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow, but what happens when the grid loses both of these energy sources at the same time?

This phenomenon is known as a compound energy drought. In a new paper, researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) found that in some parts of the country, these energy droughts can last nearly a week.

""When we have a completely decarbonized grid and depend heavily on solar and wind, energy droughts could have huge amounts of impact on the grid,"" said Cameron Bracken, an Earth scientist at PNNL and lead author on the paper.

Grid operators need to know when energy droughts will occur so they can prepare to pull energy from different sources. On top of that, understanding where, when, and for how long energy droughts occur will help experts manage grid-level battery systems that can store enough electricity to deploy during times when energy is needed most.

The team published the findings on October 31 in the journal Renewable Energy and will be presenting at this week's annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.

Hunting for cloudy, windless days

In the past, researchers studied compound energy droughts on a state or regional scale. However not much has been studied on a nationwide scale. To find out more about the risk of energy droughts over the entire continental U.S., the researchers dug into weather data and then used historical energy demand data to understand how often an energy drought occurs when that energy is needed the most.

The team examined four decades of hourly weather data for the continental U.S. and homed in on geographical areas where actual solar and wind energy plants operate today. Weather data included wind speeds at the height of wind turbines as well as the intensity of solar energy falling on solar panels. Times when the weather data showed stagnant air and cloudy skies translated into lower energy generation from the wind and solar plants—a compound energy drought.

""We essentially took a snapshot of the infrastructure as of 2020 and ran it through the 40 years of weather data, starting in 1980,"" Bracken said. ""We are basically saying, 'Here is how the current infrastructure would have performed under historical weather conditions.'""

The researchers found that energy droughts can occur in any season across the continental U.S., though they vary widely in frequency and duration. In California, for instance, cloudy and windless conditions might last several days, whereas the same conditions might last for only a few hours in Texas. Utah, Colorado, and Kansas experience frequent energy droughts both over several-hour timescales as well as several-day timescales.

The Pacific Northwest and Northeast, meanwhile, seem to experience energy droughts that last several hours more frequently than several days. The different timescales (hourly versus daily) will help inform the energy drought's impact on the grid—will it last just a few hours or several days?

Overall, researchers found that the longest potential compound energy drought on an hourly timescale was 37 hours (in Texas), while the longest energy drought on a daily timescale was six days (in California).

Energy drought at peak demand

Simply knowing the where and how of energy droughts is just one piece of the puzzle, Bracken said. He also stressed that a drought of solar and wind power won't necessarily cause an energy shortage. Grid operators can turn to other sources of energy like hydropower, fossil fuels, or energy transmitted from other regions in the U.S.

But as the nation aims to move away from fossil fuels and rely more on solar and wind power, grid operators must understand whether energy droughts will occur during times when the demand for electricity might exceed supply. Climate change brings hotter summers and more intense winter storms, and these are times when not only do people use more energy to stay safe (for cooling or heating), but access to electricity might mean life or death.

To understand the possible connection between energy droughts and energy demand, the team mapped their historical, hypothetical generation data onto 40 years of historical energy demand data that also covered real power plants across the continent.

The data showed that ""wind and solar droughts happen during peak demand events more than you would expect due to chance,"" Bracken said, meaning that more often than not, windless and cloudless periods occurred during times when demand for power was high. For now, Bracken isn't certain that the correlation means causation.

""This could be due to well-understood meteorological phenomenon such as inversions suppressing wind and increasing temperatures, but further study is needed,"" Bracken said.

Energy storage for energy droughts

Studying patterns in the frequency and duration of energy droughts will also help inform the deployment of long-duration energy storage projects, said Nathalie Voisin, an Earth scientist at PNNL and co-author of the paper. The paper is the first to provide a uniform standard of what a compound energy drought is and how long it can last in different parts of the country.

""We're providing insight on how to adequately design and manage multi-day storage. So when you know an energy drought is going to last for five hours or five days, you can incentivize storage to be managed accordingly,"" Voisin said.

Next, Bracken and the team will extrapolate weather and demand data into the future to see how climate change will affect the frequency and duration of energy droughts. The team plans to model energy droughts all the way to the end of the century combined with evolving infrastructure.

"'The Las Vegas Aces celebrate with the trophy after Game 4 of a WNBA basketball final playoff series against the New York Liberty Wednesday, Oct. 18, 2023, in New York. The Aces won 70-69. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)

NEW YORK (AP) — A’ja Wilson and the Las Vegas Aces secured their place as one of the greatest teams in WNBA history.

The Aces became the first team to repeat as champions in 21 years, getting 24 points and 16 rebounds from Wilson and a defensive stop in the closing seconds to beat the New York Liberty 70-69 in Game 4 of the Finals on Wednesday night.

“It’s not easy, as you know. This is what it’s all about,” Wilson said. “Not a lot of people get to do it. To be short-handed and win is amazing. It makes the win that much better. It’s hard to get back to the Finals to win again.”

The Aces joined the Los Angeles Sparks (2001-02) and the Houston Comets (1997-2000) as the only teams in league history to win consecutive titles.

Las Vegas did it without starters Chelsea Gray and Kiah Stokes, who were both sidelined with foot injuries suffered in Game 3. Gray, the 2022 WNBA Finals MVP, was constantly in the ear of her teammates during timeouts and shouting encouragement from the sideline. Las Vegas was also still missing veteran Candace Parker, who had foot surgery in late July.

“We’ve been facing adversity all season, playing without different players. … We have some professional fighters,” said Alysha Clark, who was pressed into the starting lineup Wednesday. “To weather the storm of everything we went through, to show up every single day. To be in this moment right now and do it together, it speaks volumes about us, our chemistry.”

Coach Becky Hammon said this was the closest team she has ever been around. The entire team attended the postgame news conference and cheered every answer, especially those by Wilson, the Finals MVP, who finished third in the regular-season MVP balloting.

With the game tied at 64, Las Vegas scored six straight points, including the first four by Jackie Young, to go ahead 70-64 with 1:26 left.

Courtney Vandersloot hit a 3-pointer on New York’s next possession, then stole the ball from Kelsey Plum, which led to Sabrina Ionescu’s foul-line jumper to get the Liberty within one with 41.7 seconds left.

On the ensuing possession, Las Vegas worked the shot clock down before Hammon called timeout with 3 seconds left on the shot clock. The Aces got the ball to Wilson on a lob, but Breanna Stewart blocked the shot, giving New York one last chance.

After a timeout with 8.8 seconds left, the Liberty got the ball to Stewart, who was double-teamed. The ball swung over to Vandersloot in the corner, but her shot missed badly, setting off a wild celebration by the Aces at midcourt.

“It’s a play we’ve ran before, get the ball to Stewie’s hand,” Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said. “Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t. We got it where we wanted to, but didn’t make it.”

Vandersloot finished with 19 points and Betnijah Laney added 15 for New York.

Hammon said before the game she would be “throwing the kitchen sink at (the Liberty), see what sticks, see what works.”

The Aces rotated defenses, which stymied New York after the Liberty scored 23 points in the first quarter.

“I think they were throwing whatever defense they had at us and make sure it’s ugly,” Stewart said. “Sometimes we lost our flow and ball movement.”

Hammon started WNBA sixth woman of the year Clark and Cayla George in place of Gray and Stokes. Clark did a stellar job on her former Seattle Storm teammate Stewart, holding her to 10 points on 3-of-17 shooting. George had 11 points.

“Just knowing what she likes to do. And just locking in and making sure that I don’t give that to her,” Clark said of guarding Stewart. “I’m so proud of this team.”

This was the first close game of the season between these teams. The four regular-season matchups were all blowouts with the closest contest being a nine-point win by New York on Aug. 28. The first three games of the WNBA Finals were also routs, with New York winning Game 3 87-73 to stave off elimination.

Game 4 was so tense that Ionescu was seen vomiting into a trash can during a timeout midway through the fourth quarter, shortly after she hit a 3-pointer to get the Liberty within 60-58. Ionescu stayed in the game after the timeout.

New York’s record fell to 2-10 all-time in the WNBA Finals. Teams that fall behind 0-2 in the best-of-five series Finals have lost all nine of those series.

STAR-STUDDED CROWD

Once again, New York drew dozens of celebrities to the game, including basketball royalty Sue Bird and Dawn Staley — the South Carolina coach who loudly cheered on her former star player, Wilson. The two embraced in a long hug after the game. Also in attendance were Liberty Ring of Honor members Vickie Johnson and Sue Wicks, and actors Jennifer Connelly, Issa Rae and Jason Sudeikis.

Aristocrat Gaming this week unveiled its full roster of NFL-themed slot machines at the Global Gaming Expo.

The Australian-based company, which has an office in Summerlin, already rolled out one of six planned NFL slots last month in Las Vegas, with the other five planned to gradually hit casino floors over the next few months.

“It’s very early on but we’re really excited about what we’re hearing from operators and players,” said Ryan Scott, vice president of gaming operations for Aristocrat. “We’ve seen a really strong response online in YouTube videos and operators have given great feedback.”

Super Bowl Jackpots served as the initial launch of the officially licensed NFL slots, with the various bonuses, that includes a field goal kicking game, and added an extra group entertainment element to the casino floor, Scott said.

“Those games have served as a center of energy on the floor,” Scott said. “My favorite part is when we do that field goal kicking feature, the crowd behind the game will either cheer or boo the player whether they make it or not. It’s a social, interactive placement on the floor.”

Over the next year the rest of the games are scheduled to begin debuting at casinos in Las Vegas and nationwide.

They include:

— Overtime Cash: Featured on the new Marquis slot cabinet, the high-limit mechanical reel game allows players to have a losing spin “intercepted” into a winning one, and offers a wheel with credit prizes and the Overtime Cash feature played in four quarters.

— Super Bowl Link: Players will try to take their favorite team to the Super Bowl while having the ability to land bonuses including Hold & Spin features and Wild Card Bonus varieties.

— NFL Kickoff: The five-reel slot game includes a bonus opportunity to get players to the red zone for a chance to score a touchdown.

— Winning Drive: The game has six different features including Championship Ring Hunt, Quarterback Pass, and Red Zone Spins.

— Rings of Victory: The three-reel style game features three different bonus wheels that can be combined with Red Zone Spins that give players a shot at the Grand progressive jackpot and credit prizes.

The addition of the NFL line is a boost to Aristocrat’s portfolio, which includes the popular Buffalo line of games, according to Scott.

“We’re obviously highlighting the NFL brand (at G2E) because it’s the largest brand that we’ve ever launched as a company and the largest brand in the industry in a number of years,” Scott said. “NFL being at the booth and showing all six games for the first time has drawn a lot of energy, but we feel that it is complementary to what we do already.”

The NFL Players Association is excited that the players they represent are included in videos played during in many of the NFL slot machines.

“The NFL-licensed slot machines offer a unique opportunity for fans across the country to be engaged in a new way,” said Terese Whitehead, the association’s vice president of consumer products and strategy. “The NFLPA is pleased with the resulting games and looks forward to seeing the excitement in action.”

With three of the six NFL-themed slots featuring Super Bowl or or “rings” in their names and the Super Bowl to be played at Allegiant Stadium in February, those visiting Las Vegas for the big game could draw a connection during their stay, Scott said.

“When I talk to some of our operators you hear a lot about ‘Big Game’ parties because you can’t use the word Super Bowl,” he said. “With our deal with the NFL and NFLPA we can use Super Bowl. So operators have a chance to have the Super Bowl on their floor for the Super Bowl.”

The two teams that will play in the big game aren’t known yet, Scott noted. “When we get the two teams those fans will get to go to one of the machines and pick the team that they want to play and have their own experience at Super Bowl, playing with their own team.”

"'The Las Vegas Aces, despite being down two starters, have now won back-to-back WNBA titles.

The Aces stormed back from an early double-digit deficit in the second half and held on in a wild fourth quarter at the Barclays Center to beat the New York Liberty 70-69 on Wednesday night in Game 4 of the 2023 WNBA Finals. That gave the Aces their second straight title, something the WNBA hasn't seen since 2002.

A'ja Wilson, who had her sixth double-double of the postseason in Game 4, was named the WNBA Finals MVP.

The Liberty jumped up early Wednesday night in Brooklyn, and took a double-digit lead almost instantly with Aces point guard Chelsea Gray and center Kiah Stokes sidelined with injuries. It seemed all but certain the Liberty were going to force a Game 5 later this week in Las Vegas.

Yet finally, late in the third quarter, the Aces turned it on. The Aces ended the third quarter on a 9-0 run and outscored the Liberty 23-12 in the period to take a two-point lead — which marked their first since the opening minutes. That 12-point lead the Liberty had earlier in the period disappeared completely, thanks to nine points from Wilson in those 10 minutes.

The Aces then opened the fourth quarter on a 7-2 run capped by a Jackie Young 3-pointer, which gave them a seven-point lead. The Liberty’s first bucket in the quarter didn’t come until a Betnijah Laney layup almost three minutes in. That seemed to bring back whatever was missing in the Liberty’s offense. Sabrina Ionescu backed it up with a 3-pointer and then Laney tied it back up with a second layup.

While the Aces pushed ahead again late, it was Ionescu — who was seen throwing up in a trash can during a timeout in the quarter — who hit a bucket from the top of the key to get New York back within one with about 40 seconds left.

Yet a final chance at a buzzer-beater from Courtney Vandersloot was just off the mark. The Aces held on to take the one-point win and seal their second straight WNBA title.

Wilson led Las Vegas with 24 points and 16 rebounds in the win, and Young added 16 points and seven assists. The Aces shot just 5-of-21 from behind the arc as a team, three of which came from Cayla George.

Vandersloot led New York with 19 points and seven rebounds. Breanna Stewart had 10 points and 14 rebounds, but shot just 3-of-17 from the field. Ionescu had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists. The Liberty shot just 36% from the field as a team.'",sports,basketball

"'It’s not uncommon for Inside the NBA analyst Charles Barkley to express his displeasure with the current state of the NBA.

Barkley has been very vocal about his opposition to current NBA players sitting out games during the season due to load management. He’s also vocalized how he feels about the modern game and his disdain for players who “jack up shots.”

Tuesday night, he made his feelings crystal clear once more.

“Watching the NBA today, man, these guys just drive me crazy… You watch these games, these guys just jack up shots… Do ya’ll know that Eric Gordon is trying to guard Anthony Davis? And you just jack up a three… There’s mismatches all over the place.”- Charles Barkley pic.twitter.com/K3val6hXoQ — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) December 6, 2023

“Watching the NBA today, man, these guys just drive me crazy,” Barkley said during halftime of the NBA In-Season Tournament Quarterfinals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns. “He had to get the offense rebound. You watch these games; these guys jack up shots…Do y’all know that Eric Gordon is trying to guard Anthony Davis? And you just jack up a three. Now, thank goodness Anthony Davis got the offensive rebound, but these guys never…because the way they play defense in the NBA, everybody switches; there’s mismatches all over the place.”

Barkley particularly lamented a sequence in Tuesday’s game, which saw Anthony Davis (6-foot-10) being guarded by Eric Gordon (6-foot-4) and seemingly unable to take advantage of the six-inch height advantage. Instead, he jacked up a shot. While Davis could retain his offensive rebound, it further proved Barkley’s point that taking advantage of mismatches appeared to be a lost art in today’s game.

If you want to accuse Sir Charles of being an old man yelling at a cloud, that’s your prerogative. Perhaps his thoughts on load management, in which he previously called out NBA players by comparing their issues to the plights of steelworkers, are more in line with that thinking.

“It ain’t like we’re working in the steel mill, brother,” Barkley said in February. “I mean, there are people working the steel mill every day. I’m pretty sure they’re tired too. But they go to work every day, so yeah, I think load management is a big deal.”

But in Barkley’s eyes, taking advantage of a mismatch shouldn’t be as difficult as working in a steel mill. And watching today’s NBA seems as enjoyable for the 60-year-old Barkley as a root canal.

Time and time again, Barkley has provided his unfiltered candor on the state of the game. Whenever Barkley opens his mouth on the NBA’s premiere studio show, it reminds us of the “What happened to the game I love?” meme.

Barkley doesn’t hesitate to express his displeasure with the current NBA landscape. His growing frustration becomes more and more evident every time we see him in studio. And while some may view him as a relic of the past, his impassioned plea for more intelligent basketball paints him as a champion of old-school fundamentals.'",sports,basketball
"'LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - U.S. Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts are ensuring that “Volleyball Day in Nebraska” is getting the recognition it deserves, even in Congress.

The two Nebraska Senators introduced a resolution to honor the record-setting event on Aug. 30 and celebrate the importance of women’s collegiate athletics in Nebraska. The resolution was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate.

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the University of Nebraska-Omaha, the University of Nebraska-Kearney, and Wayne State College all participated in the “Volleyball Day in Nebraska” event, which broke the world attendance record for a women’s sporting event with 92,003 attendees.

The previous world record was set by a UEFA Champions League soccer match in Barcelona, Spain last year that drew 91,648 fans.

The resolution congratulates the University of Nebraska, women’s volleyball athletes, and their supporters for making history on “Volleyball Day in Nebraska.” It also highlights the hard work of Coaches John Cook, Pat Sullivan, and Terry Pettit.

Ahead of the bill’s passage on Wednesday, Senators Fischer and Ricketts delivered remarks on the Senate floor to support the resolution and honor the historic occasion.

U.S. Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts are ensuring that “Volleyball Day in Nebraska” is getting the recognition they deserve, even in Congress.

Fischer said their resolution specifically honors Nebraska’s former Coach Pat Sullivan, who started the University of Nebraska volleyball program in 1975. It also honors former Coach Terry Pettit, who built the volleyball program from 1977 to 1999, and current Coach John Cook, who has sustained excellence in the program since 2000.

She added that the team has sustained excellence even since Volleyball Day in Nebraska, winning the battle of the undefeated against Wisconsin and is now ranked number one in the country.

This Senate resolution celebrates a special day for women, for volleyball players, and for Nebraskans, according to Fischer.

“I’m proud to bring well-deserved recognition to this unique accomplishment. As we often say, there is no place like Nebraska,” said Fischer.

Senator Pete Ricketts said Nebraskans played a pivotal role in the Husker women’s volleyball program achieving a new milestone, a world record, with all eyes fixed on Memorial Stadium that day.

U.S. Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts are ensuring that “Volleyball Day in Nebraska” is getting the recognition they deserve, even in Congress.

Ricketts added that the Huskers tagline is “In Our Grit, Our Glory.” Volleyball Day in Nebraska – and a new world record in attendance at a women’s sporting event – is the epitome of that motto.

“Truly, there is no place like Nebraska. Nebraska is what America is supposed to be,” stated Ricketts.

The legislation in full also recognizes the impact of the event on young women, inspiring them to pursue their aspirations as athletes and individuals. Click here to read the text of the resolution.

"'UPDATED FORECAST: Weekend winter storm could bring heavy snow to parts of state.

New Jersey can expect a relatively tranquil start to the New Year with some periods of light rain and snow flurries this week, but forecasters are closely tracking the potential for a major weekend storm that could bring “the first significant snowfall in nearly 2 years,” according to the National Weather Service.

The weather service stressed that much uncertainty remains several days ahead of the storm. Temperatures could remain warm enough by the weekend to keep the storm rain, or some mix of precipitation between northern and southern parts of the state.

“There remains great uncertainty, since lesser impact from the high to the north may allow the system to stay further northwest and bring more rain vs. snow,” the weather service said in its Monday morning forecast discussion.

“Rain of course will bring its own problems given how wet it has been of late, and onshore flow will create another coastal flood concern,” the weather service said. “Bottom line is there is a definite potential for an impactful system this weekend, but exactly what flavor those impacts take remains to be seen. Anyone with plans this weekend should keep very close eyes on the forecast as there is a high potential for fluctuations.”

The NY NJ PA Weather private forecasting company based in Monmouth County also said the “potential major winter storm for next weekend” bears watching. The company’s owner and lead meteorologist, Steven DiMartino, also cautioned about specifics this far out.

“I would not trust the details, yet,” DiMartino said on X, formerly Twitter. “But the overall signal is pretty strong.”

AccuWeather’s forecast includes two possible storm tracks as the system moves in from the south.

“There is a chance that accumulating snow can fall all the way to the Atlantic coast from this storm in the Northeast, depending on if cold air holds its ground to the north and the storm takes a track slightly more to the southeast, rather than right along the coast,” AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said.

“During the day on Sunday, the final act of the storm has the potential to bring accumulating snow to much of the mid-Atlantic and New England,” he said.

Forecasters are tracking the potential for a major winter storm that could hit New Jersey this weekend with snow.AccuWeather.com

To kick off the year, the weather service said to expect some light rain and snow showers today with temperatures in the 40s under cloudy skies.

The sun will return on Tuesday with temperatures in the low 40s during the day and lows in the 20s overnight, about normal for this time of year. Wednesday will be slightly warmer with increasing clouds and chance of precipitation, including some light snow at night.

More mixed precipitation could fall on Thursday morning, “but any amounts look very minimal,” the weather service said. Temperatures will rise into the low 40s during the day with increasing winds.

Friday will be dry and sunny, but chilly with a brisk breeze keeping wind chills in the 20s during the day.

The timing of the arrival of the weekend storm Saturday remains unclear and could be influenced by a second front that arrives ahead of the storm, the weather service said.

"'Oct 18, 2023; Brooklyn, New York, USA; New York Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu (20) during pregame warmups prior to game four of the 2023 WNBA Finals at Barclays Center. Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports

The New York Liberty suffered a brutal home loss in Game Four of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday night, watching as the Las Vegas Aces celebrated their back-to-back titles on the Barclays Center floor.

Postgame, only New York head coach Sandy Brondello and veteran stars Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot appeared for media interviews. That broke the WNBA media policy, which requires any players specifically requested by reporters to be made available. In turn, the WNBA fined New York $25,000 on Thursday.

The remaining three players from the Liberty starting lineup — Sabrina Ionescu, Jonquel Jones and Betnijah Laney — were also fined $2,000 each.

New York’s handling of postgame interviews put a spotlight on a couple other issues as well.

The WNBA and its players this year changed its media policy to close locker rooms to the press after reopening them post-pandemic for the 2022 season. Part of the league’s commitment at the time of that policy change was that player access would be more consistent pre- and post-game upon request.

By failing to uphold that standard as the home market in the Finals, the Liberty brought negative publicity to the league in its most high-profile moment.

Separately, the incident (somewhat unfairly) put Brondello in focus once again. Two years ago to the day, Brondello’s Phoenix Mercury were fined $10,000 by the WNBA for breaking the media policy following their own Finals loss.

In that case, Brondello was the only one to speak. The league did not explain why the fine was harsher this time.

Of course, Brondello deserves credit for speaking with media in both cases. Perhaps her teams leaving her out to dry twice is just coincidence.

Either way, twice in three years, players refused to uphold their Collective Bargaining Agreement and participate in mandated media interviews following a close-fought Finals.'",sports,basketball

"'Jason Sudeikis is grateful Taylor Swift has been spending so much time in his hometown of Kansas City amid her romance with Travis Kelce.

“I was thankful to Taylor, just hanging out, coming to do two nights of [Eras Tour] shows here,” Sudeikis, 48, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published on Tuesday, November 21. “All my friends, people with kids, people without kids, just had a blast. And she was like, ‘Oh, it was an amazing run.’ Little did I know, just a few months later, she’d be our adopted daughter.”

Swift, 33, performed at Arrowhead Stadium for two nights in July amid her Eras Tour, which kicked off in the spring. She returned to the state in September when Kelce, 34, invited her to watch his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, defeat the Chicago Bears. She has since been spotted back in KC various times as her relationship with Kelce continues to blossom.

Sudeikis, meanwhile, is just grateful there’s so much attention on his hometown. He noted that he often thanks musicians and comedians for opting to visit Kansas City on their tours instead of choosing bigger cities nearby like St. Louis and Chicago. The Ted Lasso alum added that he doesn’t “blame” Swift for wanting to spend time in KC — or with Kelce. “He’s a good egg,” he quipped.

Related: Stars React to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's Relationship It seems as if (almost) all of Hollywood and the NFL are in need of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce friendship bracelets. Ever since Kelce tried to meet Swift at one of her Eras Tour performances in July 2023 — he wanted to give her a friendship bracelet with his number on it, but she had […]

Swift was scheduled to return to Kansas City on Monday, November 20, to watch Travis face off against older brother Jason Kelce’s Philadelphia Eagles. Earlier this month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the pair even had plans for their parents to meet at the game now that things are getting more “serious” between them. “Taylor and Travis both have a very close bond with their parents and it’s really important that their families blend seamlessly, as well,” the insider told Us at the time.

The couple’s plans were derailed, however, when Swift — who is currently on the international leg of her Eras Tour — had to reschedule her Saturday, November 18, concert in Brazil to Monday night, due to a record-breaking heatwave.

Swift also faced tragedy while visiting the South American country after learning that fan Ana Clara Benevides Machado died while attending her Friday, November 17, show in Rio de Janeiro. Concert organizer Time for Fun (T4F) confirmed Machado’s death at the time, citing the extreme weather conditions.

Related: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s Relationship Timeline Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are all anyone can talk about. Swift and Kelce were first linked in July 2023 when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end shared he attempted to ask Swift out after attending her Eras Tour. “I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I […]

“Last night, Ana Clara felt unwell and was promptly attended to by the team of firefighters and paramedics, being taken to the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos [on-site medic] for first aid protocol,” a post on T4F’s X (formerly Twitter) page read. “Given the situation, the medical team chose to transfer her to Salgado Filho Hospital, where, after almost an hour of emergency care, she unfortunately died.”

Swift spoke out about Machado’s death via Instagram Story shortly after the show took place. “I can’t believe I’m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show. I can’t even tell you how devastated I am by this,” she said. “There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.”

While Swift added that she would not be speaking about the tragedy on stage due to being “overwhelmed with grief, ” she performed her ballad “Bigger Than the Whole Sky” at her Sunday, November 19, concert, which fans believe was dedicated to Machado.

Related: Taylor Swift! Paul Rudd! Every Celeb Who Supports the Kansas City Chiefs From actors to musicians to comedians, there are certainly a lot of famous faces who are faithful fans of the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the wake of Machado’s passing, a second source told Us that Swift has been “beside herself” but is “so grateful” to have Travis as a “huge support system.” The insider added that Swift’s team has since “reached out” to the fan’s family.'",climate,heatwave

"'WILLIAMSPORT – Little League offered to settle for $10,000 the lawsuit over the COVID-19 disqualification of two teams from the 2021 Southwest Regional Tournament in Waco, Texas.

That was revealed Tuesday in an attachment to the latest filing in Lycoming County court in the suit brought by the Needville, Texas, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, leagues.

The response by Lindsey M. Cook, who represents the two leagues, was “My clients are offended by the offer and do not wish to counter.”

Attempts to learn if the offer still was on the table were unsuccessful.

Information about the offer is contained in an exchange of emails that are exhibited to Little League’s response to the plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions and to compel discovery.

One of the emails from an attorney for Little League states it attempted to resolve the matter in good faith.

Needville and Tulsa in September sought sanctions claiming Little League had not complied with requests for discovery.

Little League asks the motion for sanctions be denied claiming it has provided all requested discovery or made due diligence to do so.

Judge Eric R. Lindhart has scheduled a hearing next Thursday on the dispute.

The teams were ousted from the tournament in Waco after a Needville coach and the Tulsa manager tested positive for the coronavirus.

Manager Sam Treat and coach Mike Park claim they were false positives because each immediately got tested on their own and the results were negative.

The two teams are seeking unspecified damages on a breach of contract claim.

They initially sought an injunction that would have placed them in the 2021 world series but it was denied.

Little League claims Needville and Tulsa have failed to identify the contractual provisions allegedly breached.

It is the contention of two leagues that on Aug. 3, 2021, a day before the tournament was to begin, teams were advised of a change in COVID-19 protocols from a positive test disqualifying a single athlete to the entire team.

They argue the change was not formally adopted, it was not available online and implemented without consultation with the tournament committee in South Williamsport. Little League denies those allegations.

The demand for damages for breach of contract is all that remains in the litigation.'",sports,baseball
"'Yes, Scott Crawford’s forthcoming Raleigh cocktail bar will be located in a basement, and yes, it will require a physical key for entry, but no, it won’t be a speakeasy—if it were, Crawford tells me, I wouldn’t have gotten a press release about it.

“We want it to feel a little bit secretive,” Crawford says. “But also, obviously we want people to know it’s there.”

Sous Terre, which means subterranean in French, will open at 620 North Person Street in February. Secrecy as an atmosphere, not a practice, makes sense for a bar that comes right out and tells you that it’s underground.

Sous Terre will occupy the space directly beneath Crawford’s French bistro, Jolie, that has been housing a bar called The Atlantic Lounge. Per the press release, Atlantic Lounge is closing at the end of the month so that owner Jason Howard can focus on expanding his Clayton taco joint, Lil Hombre, to locations in Raleigh and Wake Forest.

Unlike Atlantic Lounge, which actually did identify as a speakeasy, Sous Terre will be more of a private club: intimate and members-only but not gatekept, per se. Its age limit will be 21 and up, not 25 and up, like its predecessor. Sous Terre wants to be a popular hidden gem, Crawford says, a secret that everyone’s in on.

At the time Atlantic Lounge opened, in 2019, North Carolina had not yet gotten rid of an archaic law requiring drinks-only bars to charge membership fees. Many area bars took a path of least resistance in complying with the law, pricing membership fees at less than a dollar—some, cheekily, charged just 1 cent—and more than a few establishments straight up ignored it. Atlantic Lounge took a different approach, asking patrons to purchase a $40 key that unlocked the front door during business hours.

The keys, while a pricier form of access, have proven to come with a truly lifetime membership, one that transcends the space’s ownership: Crawford is keeping the key model and when he gives Atlantic Lounge a soft renovation, come January, he won’t be changing the locks.

“I didn’t want to change it out of respect for those who are currently members,” he says. “And, I think it’s kind of cool.”

Crawford, who may raise the key cost slightly when he opens Sous Terre but hasn’t yet worked out the numbers, doesn’t see the membership requirement as exclusionary.

The membership makes visits more intentional, he says. It may filter out people who are doing casual downtown Raleigh bar-hopping—but then again, not every establishment is intended for casual bar-hopping.

Sous Terre is Crawford’s first drinks-only concept. Its menu, which will include both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, is still in the works.

“I had questions from people after the press release came out as to whether or not we would be doing spirit-free cocktails,” Crawford says. “I kind of thought it was a given, being who I am: I’m sober for 19 years. We take spirit-free cocktails very seriously.”

The bar’s cocktail program will be led by Jordan Joseph, a four-year veteran of Crawford’s flagship restaurant, Crawford & Son. Joseph is poised to take over as beverage director for not just Sous Terre but Crawford’s entire restaurant group, Crawford Hospitality, which will expand significantly this year with Brodeto opening at Raleigh Iron Works, Crawford’s Genuine opening at RDU, and Crawford Brothers Steakhouse opening at Fenton in Cary.

“A lot of people, I think, think I’m going to be spread too thin,” Crawford says. “This is something the general public probably doesn’t know, but during COVID, I never stopped planning. For my own mental health, I stayed in my home office and planned how we could reopen strong and grow after the pandemic. It really helped me to see past what was happening day to day. So we have the infrastructure. I made a plan, and now we’ve started to execute it.”

Building that infrastructure—expansive, but sturdy—included hiring directors away from eminent restaurateurs Danny Meyer and Thomas Keller. “Those were the moves you could make during COVID,” Crawford says.

Compared to Crawford’s other three upcoming restaurants, which occupy spaces in large complexes, Sous Terre will be a breeze to get ready, Crawford says. The bones of the bar are already there. And the location is homey to the point where it might as well be called Crawford Corner: the door to Sous Terre is located inside Jolie, and Jolie is adjacent to Crawford & Son.

Jolie and Crawford & Son will keep a supply of keys on hand for customers who’d like to grab a drink downstairs before dinner. It’s something Crawford has done while Atlantic Lounge has been open, too.

“We don’t have any waiting space in Crawford & Son or Jolie,” Crawford says. “Sometimes, when people are waiting, it’s on us: they have a reservation, they’re there on time, but maybe the guests at their table haven’t left yet. So for a while now, we’ve been offering them a drink downstairs, or next door at Willco, which is another great bar.”

“We have great bars around us,” he says. “But now we’ll own one.”

"'Heavy rain and lower temperatures helped slow down some wildfires in North Carolina on Tuesday, including blazes that had prompted evacuations of homes and campgrounds, forestry officials said.





But the reprieve for crews will likely only last through the Thanksgiving weekend, since rain isn't expected again for another 10 days, according to Shardul Raval, director of fire and aviation for the U.S. Forest Service's southern region.

""Unless we get some more continuous rain, we will probably be back to being active again in a few days,"" he said.

On Saturday, a fire broke out in North Carolina's Sauratown Mountains and grew to more than 750 acres (303 hectares) by Tuesday, according to Jimmy Holt, a ranger with the North Carolina Forest Service. The rainfall helped crews reach 41% containment Tuesday, Holt said. Evacuations there have been lifted.

""It's so much better than it was a couple of days ago,"" Holt said.



The Black Bear Fire in North Carolina's Pisgah National Forest burned more than 1,800 acres (728 hectares) near the Tennessee state line, closing a portion of the Appalachian Trail in the area, officials said in a statement Tuesday. Despite Monday night's winds, officials were able to contain the blaze. The rain was expected to further cut down on the fire, but smoke would likely remain as fuels continued to smolder. As of Wednesday, the U.S. Forest Service says the fire had grown to 1,888 acres with 79% containment.

""For right now, things will slow down,"" said Adrianne Rubiaco, a U.S. Forest Service fire spokesperson in North Carolina. The slower activity will give firefighters a chance to rest and offers a chance to find and extinguish hotspots, instead of just working to slow or stop a fire's spread, she said.

Fire officials in Townsend, Tennessee, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Knoxville, announced an emergency evacuation as crews battled a blaze. It was contained and the evacuation was lifted Tuesday morning.



Western North Carolina counties were put under a state-issued burn ban for much of November due to drought conditions and increased wildfire risk. The North Carolina Forest Service announced Wednesday, Nov. 22, that it lifted a ban on all open burning outside of the 100-foot area around an occupied dwelling in most of those western counties, including Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Iredell, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey.

As of Wednesday, the Collett Ridge Fire burning in Cherokee and Clay counties had grown to 5,505 acres with 100% containment. The U.S. Forest Service said Wednesday would be the last day they would be sending out updates on the Collett Ridge and Black Bear fires, unless significant fire activity occurs.

Several counties in Western North Carolina announced they would be cancelling their local burn bans on Wednesday evening. News 13 will have more details about what this means for the mountains later Wednesday. Updates at WLOS.com.

T he monsoon is late again. Without the almost biblical rains, there is nothing to break the heat during a long stretch of days above 43°C (109°F). The pavement is scalding. Hospital wards are filling with burn victims. Even the cacti seem crispy. Many people venture out only in the early morning, before the sun rises. The rest of the time they take refuge in air-conditioned rooms: the invention that makes life in the desert possible.

This was the scene in Phoenix, Arizona in July 2023. But what if the demand for electricity to power those air-conditioners had stretched the grid to breaking point? A study published in Environmental Science and Technology, a journal, suggests that a five-day heatwave in Phoenix, with a blackout, could kill more than 13,000 people and send more than half of the city’s residents to hospital.

This is Phoenix’s worst-case scenario. But heatwaves do not not need to cause catastrophic power loss to threaten people’s lives. The urban heat-island effect means that city centres can be much hotter than surrounding areas because roads and buildings absorb and trap heat. Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix have hired “chief heat officers” to oversee emergency response and adaptation plans. In 2024, which may be the hottest year on record, more cities will appoint such officials. Ever more will adopt new technology such as cool pavements, which reflect rather than absorb sunlight. Trees will be planted for shade. City officials will open more cooling centres and try to coax unsheltered homeless people, who are among the most vulnerable to heat exhaustion, inside.

But 2024 will also bring political challenges. In America there are no federal heat protections for workers. President Joe Biden has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a national standard for worker heat-safety, but that could take years. And if Mr Biden loses the election, pending climate regulation may be scrapped. Things look only mildly better at the state level. Just five states have enacted such worker protections; all of them are run by Democrats.

Some cities in Republican-led states are taking matters into their own hands. “The state hasn’t really addressed extreme heat or carbon mitigation at all,” says Jane Gilbert, the chief heat officer for Florida’s Miami-Dade County. Yet she was the first in the world to hold her title, and, along with the mayor, has made heat a priority for the county.

Miami and Phoenix at least know that their summers will be hot. But climate change is also bringing extreme heat to places unaccustomed to it. The First Street Foundation, a non-profit group, reckons that an “extreme heat belt” will emerge in the centre of America over the next 30 years (see map). Perhaps these places, too, will soon have heat chiefs of their own. ■'",climate,forest fire

Caught testing in Michigan recently, the Ford Maverick you see above in the gallery immediately stands out next to the regular ones. First of all, it has the camouflaged front and rear ends that make it stand out. Second, it also features some updates that appear to be exclusive to this grade.Since the stickers and wraps make it hard to make out the stylistic differences at the front and rear, we can assume it has a new bumper and perhaps a reworked grille. Save for the exhaust system, the back end looks the same, though it might at least come with a different bumper, too, once it's ready.Another thing that sets it apart is the sportier stance. The model rides closer to the asphalt and sits on Y-spoke alloys that seem to be 19 inches in diameter, wrapped in Wrangler tires from Goodyear. It is certainly worth noting that our spy photographers claim the rear suspension setup suggests this prototype features an all-wheel drive system.{fullimg}Moreover, they also state that the apparently larger intercooler visible behind the front bumper might signal the presence of a punchier turbocharged engine. But that's not necessarily a sign that this street-focused Ford Maverick might actually pack a more potent mill under the hood. Guess we'll have to wait and see if it indeed uses a punchier powertrain.Our money would be on the 2.0-liter EcoBoost. The four-cylinder unit that features forced induction is good for 250 hp (254 ps/187) and 277 pound-feet (376 Nm) of torque. It is hooked up to an automatic transmission with eight gears that channels everything to the front wheels. Should you want enhanced traction, you should know that the all-wheel-drive system is an option here.As for the actual name of this Ford Maverick grade, it is believed to have been christened the Lobo , which is Spanish for wolf. You can pretty much consider it as the opposite version of the Tremor, which is an off-road-ready variant that premiered a little over one year ago. The model falls in line with the Blue Oval's head honcho's hint at additional derivatives of the Maverick, and it will make the family more appealing to shoppers.Now, you may be curious when the Ford Maverick Lobo (name unconfirmed) is due, and the latest intel suggests it could be a few months away. Our money would be on a possible introduction in the first half of 2024, with the order books opening shortly after the unveiling. Are you excited about the Maverick family gaining a new member?'",climate,earthquake
"'KINGSTON, N.Y. — A flood watch remains in effect for the Mid-Hudson Valley, the result of a storm that produced heavy rains and gusty winds as it moved up the East Coast.

The watch runs through 5 a.m. Tuesday, Dec. 19.

The National Weather Service said in a statement Sunday afternoon that widespread accumulations from 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are expected, with locally higher amounts possible. That’s higher than the 1.5 to 3 inches of rainfall forecast by the National Weather Service in a statement issued Saturday.

Sunday’s statement also said that rainfall accumulations in excess of 4 inches are expected in the east- and southeast-facing slopes of the eastern Catskills.

Along with Ulster, Dutchess, Columbia and Greene counties, all or parts of 11 other New York counties were under the flood watch. Also in the area covered by the flood watch were northwestern Connecticut, western Massachusetts and southern Vermont.

The statement added that excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying and flood-prone areas. Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks, and flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.'",climate,flood
"'Leading human rights organization Amnesty International claims that the legacy for migrant workers in Qatar following the 2022 World Cup is in “serious peril” as the one-year anniversary of the tournament nears.

In a briefing titled “A Legacy in Jeopardy,” Amnesty International said that it “finds that just as the glare of the world’s media spotlight dimmed, so too did the [Qatar] government’s push for fair conditions and decent work for the hundreds of thousands of men and women who helped realize Qatar’s World Cup dream and will continue to keep the country moving for many years to come.”

In a statement sent to CNN, Qatar’s International Media Office responded to Amnesty International’s findings, stating the “positive impact of Qatar’s labor reforms is evident for all to see.”

The statement read: “The World Cup accelerated labor reforms in Qatar, creating a significant and lasting tournament legacy. Qatar now leads the region on workers’ rights and labor reforms, setting an example for other countries on how a system can be successfully overhauled.

“The commitment to strengthen Qatar’s labor system and safeguard workers’ rights was never an initiative tied to the World Cup and was always intended to continue long after the tournament ended.”

Amnesty International said that some previous issues had been improved – workers were able to leave the country and are more freely able to change jobs. However, the organization maintained that, despite FIFA and Qatar’s claims of progress, not enough has been done for workers’ rights in Qatar.

“Reforms belatedly introduced and weakly enforced by the Qatari government, and FIFA’s introduction of a human right policy in 2017, failed to prevent widespread abuses occurring in the lead up to and during the tournament, and abuses continue today,” the human rights organization added.

In the build-up to last year’s World Cup, the organizers received widespread criticism for their treatment of migrant workers.

In 2021, The Guardian reported that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.

The report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.

Hassan Al Thawadi, the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations, told CNN’s Becky Anderson that The Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.

In a 2021 report, Amnesty International said that Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.

Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic Social Justice, believes that Qatar “must renew efforts to improve workers’ rights.”

He added: “Qatar’s continued failure to properly enforce or strengthen its pre-World Cup labor reforms puts any potential legacy for workers in serious peril.

“The government must urgently renew its commitment to protecting workers, while both FIFA and Qatar should agree to remediation plans for all those who suffered.”

The organization said that it is unaware of improvements in investigating workers’ deaths, that wages continue to be stolen from workers by employers and that migrant workers’ rights continue to be abused.

Amnesty International also reiterated its 10-point plan which was published in the build-up to the 2022 World Cup. The plan includes calls to end forced labor, allow trade unions and to compensate historic abuses.

In support of Qatar, FIFA added that it is “undeniable that significant progress has taken place,” in a statement sent to CNN.

But soccer’s international governing body admitted: “It is equally clear that the enforcement of such transformative reforms takes time and that heightened efforts are needed to ensure the reforms benefit all workers in the country.”

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey has filed a request for President Joe Biden to declare a major disaster happened in the city of Leominster when it was hit by flooding more than 90 days ago.The Leominster Mayor's Office said Healey filed the disaster declaration request to the federal government Monday, which marked the three-month anniversary of the devastating Sept. 11 flood in Leominster.The declaration includes a request for both individual assistance to Leominster homeowners and business owners, as well as city infrastructure damage.The Mayor's Office said Leominster residents and businesses have submitted 1,400 damage forms to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency and Federal Emergency Management Agency.Arthur and Joanne Obin, a retired couple in their 70s, still cannot live in their home at the corner of Pleasant and Colburn streets when nearly a foot of rain fell in Leominster on the night of Sept. 11.The Obins barely escaped with their lives as the tiny stream that flows under their home's foundation started eating away at the front of the house.""I looked out the front picture window, and the street collapsed, and a kind of a tidal wave came up as a result of it,"" Joanne Obin said. ""That's when we knew we had to get out.""The couple said their mortgage was paid off, and the house had been renovated just the way they wanted when their property was ravaged by the flooding.""This has been our home for 34 years. We raised our son here,"" Arthur Obin said before he was overcome by emotion.The Obins had homeowners insurance but not flood insurance, and they said they have not received any money from insurance thus far. A few weeks ago, the couple got tired of sitting around in the basement apartment they are now living in and began cleaning up their yard.""We shoveled out the driveway a wheelbarrow at a time,"" Joanne Obin said.The couple said an engineer has told them their home can be saved, so they are hoping the government will pay for part of the repairs so they can be in their beloved house when they celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary next year.""I'd like to see her in her home again,"" Arthur Obin said. Leominster officials have informed MEMA and FEMA of more than $30 million in damages to 75 city sites. The Mayor's Office said that the damage estimate was determined by the city engineer and three engineering firms who assisted in the process.""I'm cautious about it and optimistic, but I'd be surprised if they said: 'No,'"" said Leominster Mayor Dean Mazzarella.The Massachusetts Department of Transportation reported an estimated $6 million in costs related to the flood damage in Leominster, according to city officials.The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority made an estimated $390,000 in estimated repairs related to the Commuter Rail tracks that were compromised by the flooding.Related story:'",climate,flood

MADRID (AP) — The former president of the Spanish soccer federation has been ruled unfit to work in the sport in Spain for three years after he kissed a player on the lips without her consent at the Women’s World Cup final.

Luis Rubiales had already been forced to resign from his post after he initially tried to stay in office despite a global uproar over Rubiales kissing forward Jenni Hermoso at the trophy ceremony following the Aug. 20 final in Australia.

Friday's ruling by the legal panel that oversees sports in Spain comes after world soccer governing body FIFA had already banned Rubiales for three years.

A Spanish judge is investigating accusations by Hermoso that Rubiales sexually assaulted her with his kiss and then pressured her to publicly support him afterward.

He has denied any wrongdoing.

European clubs aiming to join a breakaway Super League received some good news on Thursday thanks to a landmark court ruling.

The European Court of Justice deemed that UEFA and FIFA's bans on the formation of a Super League are ""unlawful"" and that the organizations are ""abusing a dominant position"" in their control of the sport in Europe by threatening to sanction clubs that want to join the breakaway league, according to Alex Kirkland and Rodrigo Faez of ESPN.

""There is no framework for the FIFA and UEFA rules ensuring that they are transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate,"" the court said.

""Similarly, the rules giving FIFA and UEFA exclusive control over the commercial exploitation of the rights related to those competitions are such as to restrict competition, given their importance for the media, consumers and television viewers in the European Union.""

The Super League saga began in April 2021 when 12 teams, including the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Barcelona, Real Madrid, AC Milan and Juventus, had signed up for the breakaway competition, which aimed to replace the UEFA Champions League.

Due to widespread backlash from fans, European leagues, UEFA and FIFA, plans for the Super League collapsed within a few days as multiple clubs withdrew from the competition.

The Super League, backed by A22 Sports, then filed a lawsuit seeking protection from potential UEFA sanctions.

With Thursday's ruling, UEFA and FIFA cannot block a Super League from being formed, though the court also stated that the decision ""does not mean that a competition such as the Super League project must necessarily be approved.""

Following Thursday's ruling, the Super League revealed an updated proposal for a three-league, 64 club men's competition and a two-league, 32 club women's competition that would replace the UEFA Champions League.

The men's competition would feature two leagues consisting of 16 teams each—known as the ""Star League"" and ""Gold League""—and a third league referred to as the ""Blue League"" with 32 teams. Promotion and relegation would exist between the leagues and teams would be added to the third league based on domestic league performance.

Competition would consist of a minimum of 14 matches per year with an eight-club knockout stage determining the winner of each league.

""We'll keep working with clubs, leagues and other parties, without the fear of punishment, to create the best European football competitions,"" A22 chief executive Bernd Reichart said. ""We reaffirm our commitment to national leagues and the pyramid structure of football. For the first time since 1955, European competitions could be managed by the participating clubs themselves.""'",sports,soccer

Biography

Acquired in a 1992 trade, former Red and Ohio native Paul O’Neill made an irreplaceable impact in his near decade in pinstripes. He was a fiery, hard-nosed right fielder with a knack for reaching base and performing under the sport’s brightest spotlights. O’Neill was a staple in the heart of the lineup throughout one of baseball’s most dominant stretches in the form of the late 90s Bombers, and duly earned a spot in our Top 100 Yankees of all time.

Early Years

Paul O’Neill was born to Virginia and Charles “Chick” O’Neill in Columbus, Ohio in February of 1963. Chick was a former minor league pitcher, while his father also had roots in professional baseball. Paul, the youngest of six O’Neill children, was blessed in a baseball sense, given his family’s past in the game, as well as their move to a home with a sizeable yard when Paul was young, big enough to hold a makeshift baseball diamond. This field had a tree out in right field, which seemed to help O’Neill master the art of hitting the ball the other way as a lefty, something quite evident in his 17-year big league career. He even remarked that “that back yard was the best training ground for any future professional [ballplayer], and those home run derby games were especially ferocious.”

O’Neill learned the game on that field in Ohio, while rooting on the Cincinnati Reds. His father took him to his first big league game in 1970, where the Reds took on the Pirates. There, a young Paul took a liking to Pittsburgh’s right fielder, who wore number 21, Roberto Clemente. He clearly was impacted by Clemente’s abilities and presence on the field, as O’Neill wore that same number in the same position for his entire eventual Major League career.

O’Neill attended Brookhaven High School in Columbus, where he played football, basketball, and baseball, excelling particularly on the diamond. The big left-hander received college scholarship offers for both baseball and basketball but also drew the eyes of professional baseball scouts, including those of his beloved Reds. He elected to go the way of pro baseball, a decision that would prove wise, and the Reds selected him in the fourth round of the 1981 draft.

Slow Rise to Big League Stardom

As a teenager, O’Neill had a pair of fine-enough seasons between Rookie and A-ball in ‘81 and ‘82. He worked his way up to Double-A in the following two seasons, then began the 1985 season with the triple-A Denver Zephyrs. After hitting .305 in Denver, O’Neill got his first call-up to the major leagues, making his debut on September 3, 1985. As a pinch-hitter, he lined a single into right field for his first major league hit. He would appear in just five games that year, and only in three the next year, but things would get rolling in ‘87. Across 160 plate appearances, O’Neill had a 111 wRC+ and cemented himself in the starting lineup going forward.

Between 1988 and 1990, O’Neill averaged 16 homers and slashed .266/.330/.757 with a 108 wRC+. In 1989, his best season to that point, he had one of his more memorable moments as a player. With the winning run rounding third in a July game against the Phillies, O’Neill thought he had bobbled the game away on a single that rolled his way. In somewhat typical fashion, he wore his emotions on his sleeve and kicked the ball away in disgust, a move that improbably ended up saving the game.

For the World Series-winning 1990 Reds, Paulie showed off his ability to shine in October, as he OPS’d .946 in 36 plate appearances that postseason. He earned his first All-Star nod in 1991, one of the best seasons of he enjoyed, where he belted a career-high 28 homers for Cincy.

1992 was a modest-but-down season in southwest Ohio for O’Neill, who had been pressed to attempt to hit for even more power by similarly-tempered skipper Lou Piniella. It didn’t take as his homer total was cut in half, and the player/manger relationship really began to fray. Despite the security he felt with the organization as a whole, it spelled the end of his time with the Reds.

A Decade of Success in the Bronx

In November of 1992, the Yankees acquired O’Neill’s services from the Reds in return for an All-Star of their own, Roberto Kelly. Growing up a Reds fan, O’Neill wasn’t thrilled with the move, but he rather quickly adjusted, and he wrote that “Once I’d set foot inside Yankee Stadium and met with Steinbrenner and general manager Gene Michael, I could see that a whole new baseball life was out there.”

Paulie’s play on the field was no worse for the wear either, as he enjoyed perhaps his best big league season at the plate in his first year in the Bronx. He went 4-for-4 in his Bronx debut, got back over 20 homers once again, slugged over .500 for the first time, and reached a then-career-high 134 wRC+.

O’Neill’s second season in the Bronx would be one for the ages, but one ultimately riddled with what-ifs. The 1994 season was famously cut short by the player strike, but in his 103 games, O’Neill played the best baseball of his life. By the end of April, he was average sat at an astonishing .448, and didn’t drop below .400 until mid-June. The Yankees also had a league-best 70-43 record when play stopped.

O’Neill belted 21 homers in two-thirds of a season while leading the league with a .359 average, and he was elected to his second All-Star team and finished fifth in MVP voting. His remarkable year certainly made an impression on the Yankees, as they inked him to a four-year, $19-million deal, locking him into the heart of some excellent Yankee years to come.

With the strike resolved, O’Neill largely picked up where he left off, as 1995 was yet another standout season for the right fielder. He had a 135 wRC+ across 543 plate appearances, topped 20 homers for the third straight year (including three in one game during the intense September stretch run), and earned his second consecutive All-Star selection. In MLB’s first year with Wild Card teams in the mix, the Yankees made it to the dance as just that. They would take on the Mariners in the the first iteration of the Division Series, in what would become a legendary back-and-forth matchup.

In the five-game duel, O’Neill was a force to be reckoned with. We all know how the series ultimately ended, but he homered three times and slashed .333/.458/.833. This included a game-tying blast in Game 2, which came an inning after captain Don Mattingly’s iconic “hang onto the roof” homer.

1996 rolled around, and the Yankees had a chip on their shoulder, and O’Neill kept on rolling in his age-33 campaign. He swatted 19 homers and hit over .300 yet again, and enjoyed his best on-base season to date (outside of the shortened ‘94) in which he walked 15.5 percent of the time, and maintained an elite .411 OBP en route to another solid 127 wRC+ season. The Yanks of course reached the postseason once again, this time going all the way and defeating the reigning champion Braves to capture their first World Series since 1978.

Playing through injury, O’Neill was not as potent this go-around, but as seen at the end of a 1-0 nailbiter World Series Game 5 in Atlanta, he would not be deprived of an unforgettable October moment.

The calendar turned to 1997, and Paul O’Neill stayed the same. 21 homers, .324/.399/.514 slash line, 139 wRC+, and another All-Star nod; Paulie was as consistent as they come. The Yankees would lose in the ALDS, but it had nothing to do with O’Neill, as he was even better this time around. He homered twice and reached base in half of his plate appearances.

1998 was a year, as we covered in great detail, in which just about everything went right for the Yankees, and O’Neill was no exception. He once again put up his near-patented stat line, 24 homers and a 129 wRC+ in 152 games, in what was his most valuable season according to fWAR, with a figure of 5.4. He earned his fifth All-Star selection, and the Yankees won a then-record 114 games in the regular season. They swept the Rangers in the DS, and ultimately defeated Cleveland for the American League pennant. They would take on the Padres in that year’s Fall Classic, and sweep their way to their rightful spot atop the mountain. O’Neill was solid in the championship run, holding up an .806 OPS across 60 plate appearances with a homer in each of the first two series.

At 36 years old, Paulie began the 1999 season strong but fell into a deep slump in May. His average fell to .244 at one point, but he persisted through the struggles and turned things around with a strong June and July. The Bombers won another 98 games and returned to the playoffs again. In early October, however, chasing a foul pop-up, O’Neill crashed into the wall and walked away with a cracked rib that would hinder him for the rest of their run.

The Yankees swept the Rangers and beat the Red Sox in the Championship Series to return to the Classic yet again, albeit with a limited O’Neill. The rib injury was not the whole of it either, as his O’Neill’s father’s health was rapidly deteriorating. He suffered a heart attack in June, and appeared to be in decline by the time the World Series rolled around. With much on his mind, O’Neill still did his best to contribute.

Shortly after Game 3, Chick O’Neill passed away. A crushed Paul considered not playing Game 4, but ultimately played through the turmoil, and helped the Yanks win their third championship in four years.

O’Neill considered retirement following that season, but elected to come back after the Yanks picked up his $6.5 million option. He was by no means bad, but his 92 wRC+ marked the first and only below average offensive season of his career. He was no black hole in the lineup though, churning 18 homers and 100 RBI amidst the down year, and the Yankees went on to their third consecutive World Series. O’Neill hit .310 in the postseason en route to a fifth ring in his decorated career, as the Yankees took down the crosstown Mets in the millennium's first Fall Classic. Luis Sojo had the most famous hit of the Subway Series, but O’Neill’s 10-pitch battle with closer Armando Benitez in the ninth inning of Game 1 made the game-tying rally possible as the Bombers won the opener.

His status was up in the air again for 2001, but O’Neill ultimately returned for one more season in the Bronx. His regular season ended with injury trouble, but it was still a productive one. O’Neill oddly set a career high with 22 stole bases at 37-years-old, and became the oldest player to record a 20-homer/20-steal season.

The Yankees returned to the World Series, ultimately losing in heartbreaking fashion to the Diamondbacks, but O’Neill’s final games as a major leaguer were great ones. He homered twice and managed a 123 wRC+ in the postseason, with his health likely less than 100 percent. It’s fitting he would play his last games like this, grinding through pain, but producing just like he had for the last 17 seasons. He officially hung up the cleats after the 2001 season, but not before the Yankee Stadium crowd chanted Paulie’s nickname for the final time.

A Model of Fire, Winning, and Consistency

There is a solid argument for Paul O’Neill being the heart of that incredible Yankees run in the late ‘90s. He spent nine seasons in the Bronx, six of them with 20 homers (never less than 18), boasted a .377 OBP, had a 125 wRC+, and was a staple in the middle of those potent lineups. Even through injuries or personal loss, you knew what you were getting from O’Neil. He was as consistent as they come. You also knew you were getting someone who wouldn’t take failure sitting down:

Now a YES Network announcer, Paul O’Neill’s tremendous impact on the Yankees would not go unrecognized, as he would have his number retired in Monument Park during the 2022 season, forever cementing his place in Yankee history. He could be trusted day in and day out in the lineup, and though he shouldn’t be trusted around a water cooler, he is more than deserving of a spot in our Top 100.

"'Serena Williams attends The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes on Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 06, 2019 in New York City.

Serena Williams is taking her talents from the tennis court to the keyboard. The 42-year-old shared she recently signed a two-book deal with the Random House Publishing Group. According to ABC News, the first project is a currently untitled memoir.

“For so long, all I was focused on was winning, and I never sat down to look back and reflect on my life and career,” explained the professional athlete.

“Over the last year, I’ve really enjoyed taking the time with my growing family to celebrate my accomplishments and explore my other passions. I couldn’t be at a more perfect place to be able to take on such a personal intimate project, and there’s no one I would rather do it with than the team at Random House.”

The promised book stands as Williams’ second memoir, the first being On The Line issued in 2009. In the new work described as an “open-hearted exploration of the experiences that have shaped her life,” the 23-time Grand Slam champion plans to go deeper.

According to the publisher, Williams shares her experiences with “overcoming scrutiny and attacks in a predominantly white and male-dominated sport, navigating devastating losses on and off the court, falling in love with tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, celebrating body diversity and expanding the confines of style in sports and pop culture, bringing awareness to maternal health disparities, and being a devoted mother to her daughters, Olympia and Adira.”

The second book in the works from the mother of two takes a different path. Described as “inspirational,” the publisher details, “Williams will offer rules for living that draw on her experiences as a philanthropist and advocate, her career as an investment unicorn with Serena Ventures, and someone who has long sought to lift a diverse and emergent generation of young women whose aspirations are not confined to the court.”

In 2022, the tennis star announced her retirement from the sport ahead of the U.S. Open, describing her transition to other endeavors as “evolving.”

In addition to On The Line, Williams previously authored the children’s book The Adventures of Qai Qai released last year.'",sports,tennis

"'AUSTIN (KXAN) — Austin Water is updating its drought contingency plan and is asking for your input at a virtual meeting Tuesday evening.

Every five years, the State of Texas requires that Austin Water update their plan for how the city deals with drought, including how often water customers can water their lawns or wash their cars. The last plan was approved in 2019. Austin Water is scheduled to submit an updated drought contingency plan to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for approval May 1, 2024.

“We have changing climate, we have changing inflows into the reservoirs,” Kevin Kluge, water conservation division manager at Austin Water, said. “But also we have changing customers. We have more people coming to the community, more businesses. We need a new plan for a new time.”

Austin has been under stage two water restrictions since August, when the amount of combined water in lakes Travis and Buchanan dropped below 900,000 acre-feet. One acre-foot is enough water to cover a football field in water one foot deep.

Under the current stage two restrictions, residential automatic sprinklers can only run once per week between the designated hours of midnight until 5 a.m., or 7 p.m. until midnight.

Current Austin Water restrictions

Combined water levels in lakes Travis and Buchanan currently sit at 833,000 acre-feet. According to Austin Water, stage three water restrictions will be triggered if water levels drop to 600,000 acre-feet. Stage four restrictions occur under even more severe drought restrictions or in the event of an emergency.

“One of the things we’re looking at in this new drought plan is to add a stage in between there at 750,000 acre-feet, so that we can respond a little more readily,” Kluge said. “We don’t have to go all the way down to 600 [thousand acre-feet] and then say ok, now we need to do something different.”

Other ideas Austin Water is considering in its drought contingency plan update include more rebates to customers who take steps to conserve water, such as installing a pool cover to limit evaporation, or enhancing enforcement measures.

How to attend Tuesday’s meeting

The virtual meeting takes place at 6 p.m. Tuesday evening, where the public will have a chance to ask questions about the current drought plan and speak up about proposed changes.

Click here to register for and attend Austin Water’s virtual meeting. Austin Water’s Speak Up Austin page also has a written questionnaire water customers can complete, and submit their own ideas.

"'The Horn of Africa and southern Africa saw the most people move during droughts, according to a new continent-scale assessment of settlement locations in Africa

Press Release 23-47

21 December 2023

For Immediate Release

This press release is also available online at: https://news.agu.org/press-release/fleeing-drought-vulnerable-populations-face-flood-risk-in-most-african-countries

AGU press contact:

Liza Lester, +1 (202) 777-7494, news@agu.org (UTC-5 hours)



Contact information for the researchers:

Serena Ceola, University of Bologna, serena.ceola@unibo.it (GMT+1 hours)

WASHINGTON — In 80% of African countries, moved toward rivers and into cities during or following drought, increasing the number of people living in flood-risk areas in recent decades, according to a new study. This resettlement pattern will likely intensify in coming decades as climate change is expected to make droughts more frequent and severe.

""It's a cycle that exacerbates how many people are negatively impacted by drought, and not only in the ways we might normally expect,"" said Serena Ceola, a hydrologist at the University of Bologna in Italy who led the study. ""As regional climates change and both droughts and floods become bigger problems, more people will struggle to find a safe place to settle. People may move from one drought-affected place to another or move somewhere that just poses different climate risks.""

In Somalia, for example more than 3.8 million people have been displaced in part by drought over the last three years. Many of those climate refugees sought shelter near rivers, where farming could resume, but heavy rains and flash floods then displaced more than half a million people.

The study was published in Earth’s Future, which publishes interdisciplinary research on the past, present and future of our planet and its inhabitants. Prior to this study, research on drought-driven migrations in Africa focused on single countries or specific drought events, limiting scientists’ understanding of how drought influences patterns of human settlements at large scales. The new study is the first to examine changes in human settlement patterns associated with droughts on a continental scale.

“We want the whole society to be aware of just how many people are moving from one climate threat to another,” Ceola said.

Untangling drought

Droughts may push people closer to rivers to continue agricultural activities, and others may adapt by moving to cities, which offer diverse economic opportunities when drought limits agriculture. Scientists have hypothesized that drought can be a main driver of human displacement, but many factors — often inextricably linked to drought itself — can contribute to displacement. Drought can exacerbate conflict, political violence and food and job insecurity, each of which can prompt mass migrations on their own.

The researchers chose to focus on drought alone due to its potential impact on many different factors. They used two indices, EM-DAT and SPEI-12, which respectively reflect socioeconomic and evapotranspiration impacts of drought, to look for droughts in 50 African countries from 1992 to 2013. They included in their analyses the years preceding and following the drought to test for strength of the drought signal and lingering effects of drought on human movement.

To determine whether people moved to rivers, the researchers used satellite-based nighttime light detection to check for either changes in existing settlements’ luminosities or the development of new settlements. They used annual, country-based World Bank census data to track populations in urban centers.

Where does drought drive people?

The study found people moved toward rivers or urban centers in up to 80% of African countries experiencing droughts as indicated by at least one of the two indices used. During drought years identified by at least one of the indices, about half to three-quarters of all studied countries had settlements move closer to rivers, and one-third to half of countries had urban populations grow. The urban-growth signal could have been weaker than river-based migration because people may move to cities for many reasons, Ceola said.

Seventeen countries experienced droughts according to both drought indices during the study period. Up to 65% of those countries saw increased human movement toward rivers during drought years when the pre-drought year was included in the analysis.

Notably, all countries in southern Africa saw drought-related migration toward rivers based on at least one drought index over the study period. Ceola pointed to Burundi, Guinea Bissau and Namibia as particularly interesting.

The methods have some limitations. Nighttime lights are used as a proxy for human settlements and activities, meaning that the amount of observed light may not reflect the number of people. Smaller concentrations of lights may not show up, and it might leave out the poorest groups that lack enough lights to appear. Limited data for many regions and populations on the continent mean scientists have to get creative with the sources of information available to prepare people and governments for current and future hazards, Ceola said.

“Policy makers need data and detailed information in order to implement strategic planning, support sustainable development and increase the resilience of people living in vulnerable areas. Likewise, people living in those areas need to be aware of the risks and should have the opportunity to freely move to safer locations,” Ceola said.

"'Today's Lineups DIAMONDBACKS PHILLIES Corbin Carroll - RF Kyle Schwarber - DH Ketel Marte - 2B Trea Turner - SS Tommy Pham - DH Bryce Harper - 1B Christian Walker - 1B Alec Bohm - 3B Gabriel Moreno - C Bryson Stott - 2B Lourdes Gurriel - LF J.T. Realmuto - C Alek Thomas - CF Nick Castellanos - RF Evan Longoria - 3B Brandon Marsh - LF Geraldo Perdomo - SS Johan Rojas - CF Merrill Kelly - RHP Aaron Nola - RHP

Well, I guess it was a BIT too much to expect we’d go through the entire post-season undefeated! But if the D-backs can come back and win behind Merrill Kelly this evening, then the series will be well and truly on. We certainly do not want a repeat of the start last night, where two of the first three Phillies hitters went deep off Zac Gallen, as the home team feasted on poorly-located fastballs. Still, it was a closer score than the first game of the 2007 NL Championship Series against Colorado. There, Arizona was at home, and scored first on an RBI double by Eric Byrnes, But just like last night, our ace (then Brandon Webb) wasn’t able to get it done, and the D-backs lost 5-1 to the Rockies.

There’s a case to be made that Kelly, rather than Gallen, was the team’s ace in the second half. His ERA of 3.38 was certainly better than Gallen’s 4.03 - that’s actually closer to Brandon Pfaadt’s 4.22 than Kelly. That said, a point of possible concern is that Kelly, like Gallen, has pitched better at home than on the road. Nobody seems to have mentioned that much. In the regular season, Gallen’s road ERA was 1.95 runs higher; Kelly isn’t quite at that level, but the gap of 1.48 runs is still significant. That may have been bloated by late outings against the Mets and Dodgers where Kelly got raked, allowing seven earned runs over five innings in each start.

Another day, another unchanged line-up. Outside of the starting nine, the only bench player to have received more than a single PA through the first six games is Jose Herrera. And that’s probably only because of Gabriel Moreno’s single-handed efforts at turning the 2023 playoffs into his own personal remake of Jackass. Emmanuel Rivera has appeared in four games, with Jace Peterson and Pavin Smith in two apiece - but each man has only managed a single plate-appearance. Jordan Lawlar entered one as a pinch-runner, but is yet to come to the dish in the postseason. Torey clearly intends to ride his nine horsemen until they fall dead, and with the off-days built in, and the drop-off to our bench, I can’t say I blame him.

Let’s see how tonight goes. Arizona managed only one at-bat with a runner in scoring position last night, but Nola should present a less overpowering challenge than Zack Wheeler. His ERA+ in the regular season was a mediocre 96; his FIP was better than his ERA, mostly due to Nola allowing more than an expected number of home-runs. He gave up 32 home-runs over 193.2 innings, which ranked him third in the league. So perhaps it will be time for the D-backs to play a little Home-run Derby against the opposing starter. It’s definitely an important game to win. Doing so would take home-field advantage, while defeat would send us back to Arizona in a 2-0 hole, facing a stiff uphill climb.'",sports,baseball

On Saturday, county officials said that an assessment of the overnight wave impacts on the coast appeared “minimal,” though, they did discover “significant sand loss on beaches.”

High swells that were expected overnight didn’t end up materializing in the seaside village of Capitola, which was hit hard on Thursday, according to Capitola Public Works Director Jessica Kahn.

The National Weather Service had advised people to stay away from beaches during the warnings, which covered the entire Bay Area, Santa Cruz County and Monterey coastlines. By 2 p.m., they downgraded the high surf warning to an advisory until 10 p.m. as waves were on the decline. Coastal conditions, however, still remain hazardous with officials warning that waves could still reach 16 to 20 feet.

"'New York Liberty and Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai really struck a nerve with Michael Wilbon.

The two sides have now each fired a salvo in a war of words that began on Friday’s edition of ESPN’s “Pardon the Interruption” when Wilbon was asked to pick a winner in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals and went into a rant about poor acoustics for crowd noise at the Barclays Center.

“I’ve got the Aces,” Wilbon said to co-host Frank Isola, as covered by Awful Announcing.

“You need a rabid, Phillies-like crowd in Brooklyn. Oh, wait. They’re barely awake in Brooklyn. It is the worst homecourt advantage, homecourt situation in terms of spirit in the entire NBA — all 30 teams (maybe Washington) — and the entire WNBA — all whatever it is, 12 teams? It’s the worst.

“There’s nothing to rally the Liberty. I want to see a series, Frank. It’s not happening. It’s not.”

Wilbon compared the Barclays Center noise levels to a “library” and added that “you hipsters better get a real arena because you stink right now.”

After the Liberty won convincingly in Game 3 on Sunday, a fan mockingly posted on X a reference about Wilbon saying “Worst home court advantage in the WNBA” with a video of a raucous crowd attached.

This tweet caught Tsai’s eye.

“We’d like to invite @RealMikeWilbon to his first WNBA game on Wednesday at Barclays Center,” the Nets owner said in a re-share.

On Monday’s “PTI,” Wilbon doubled down on his take, clarifying that it was the arena and not the team’s fans that he was taking aim at.

“Let me just say this to Joe Tsai, who tweeted at me yesterday. Let’s be clear about something: I didn’t criticize your league or your fanbase or even your team,” Wilbon mused.

“I criticized your building, which is awful. Dark, quiet, and awful. So let’s get something straight about that you and your minions don’t confuse it. The Liberty bounced back well yesterday. This is now a series. And don’t think, ‘Oh, let’s invite Wilbon to his first WNBA game.’ I was a season ticket holder before you knew where the league was. Let’s get all that straight.”

Tony Kornheiser asked Wilbon if he meant that the Barclays Center is a “dump,” to which Wilbon responded, “No, it’s dark and it’s quiet and it’s not Vegas. It’s not one of the top places you go to get fired up and amped up for your team. It’s not.”

"'When it comes to survival games, they come in all shapes, sizes, and settings. These ones in 20244 will test players in numerous ways.

#21 Palworld

We’re starting this survival games list with Palworld. Why? Because we don’t like this game, and it keeps popping up on our lists somehow! So we get rid of it early to talk about games we honestly want to discuss!

Anyway, this “survival game” is based on a world full of monstrous creatures that you can collect and put to work in various ways. Do you want to battle with them? You can do that. Or you can make them a workforce. Or you can give them weapons so that they can defeat others that way. Or you can eat them. Yes, that’s something you can do in the game.

#20 War Hospital

To free ourselves from the last game, let’s talk about a title about survival in a more emotional sense. In War Hospital, you’ll be part of a battlefield hospital in World War I. This is still the “dark age” of medicine, and you need to do all you can to help the soldiers that come into your care.

Your decisions will affect their treatment and how things go. You’ll want to build up a staff to treat as many people as possible. But you’ll also need to maintain your supplies to do the treatments as much as possible!

Life and death are in your hands. Will you be able to do what is right and save lives?

#19 Dread Pilots

The last game might have been a bit morbid for you, and we’re sorry if that was the case. So how about we go to a sci-fi future where you get trapped in a nightmare dimension? That sounds fun, right?

In Dread Pilots, you are truly trapped in a realm where there are dangers in every direction you look, and your ship won’t be able to handle them unless you outfit it with a crew and weapons to take them on.

Your mission is simple: find a way out! But with so many threats, is there even a way out? There’s plenty to do in this game just to survive, so keep your head on a swivel and look out!

#18 Once Human

We’ve shown you some rather dark games so far, and we will continue that trend! Why? Because we can!

In Once Human, you’ll be in a world that has become infected with an alien entity called “Stardust.” And when we say “infected,” we mean that in the broadest sense. Everything from the people, the animals, the water, the food, the ground, and everything in between has been infected!

Thus begins you’re struggle. You are one of the few that can fight against the monsters that lurk everywhere. But without food and water, you’ll lose your sanity. But if you ingest it, you’ll become more infected. What will you do?

#17 The Alters

One of the most dangerous situations to be in is one where you have to rely on yourself alone to get through a challenge. In The Alters, you’ll have no one but yourself and your past selves to free you from a planet you are trapped on.

The game will allow you to “summon” past versions of yourself that made different choices in their lives. Through these “alters,” you’ll have many hands, and potentially get to do light work.

But with each Alter you summon, the strain on your mind will increase. You’ll need to work through the problems of your past if you hope to survive the present and make it to the future. Think you can handle that?

#16 Crashlands 2

After the events of the first game, a certain trucker wanted nothing more than to take a vacation and not have to worry about being thrown into an intense survival situation. So, in Crashlands 2, he goes to take that vacation and gets thrown into a new and very intense survival situation! Such a lucky guy.

Alone and in a part of the world you’re not familiar with, you’ll have to do everything you can to make it out alive and get through the aliens and dangers that this place has.

The good news is that you can make friends and have them help you survive. It’s a big alien world out there, so do your best not to die.

#15 Pacific Drive

Welcome to the Olympic Excursion Zone. Here, within the Pacific Northwest, nothing is as it should be, and a storm that’s chasing you is the least of your problems!

This roguelike game will have you dealing with random events as you try and get out alive. The bad news is that you only have your car to help you. The good news is that you can upgrade said car to help you deal with whatever comes your way.

The trick is that you’ll face new dangers with each attempt to get through the zone. What will happen with each run? That’s something you’ll have to experience yourself.

#14 HeatWave

How do you survive a HeatWave? Simple, you get inside, you turn on the air conditioning, and you hope you don’t fry in the process.

Oh, this is about a game called that? Our bad. The game focuses on a potential future where global warming has forced the continental United States to cut itself off from Alaska, and that leaves it open to a united front of Russia and China. Why? Because Russia used to own the state before they sold it to the US, and they want it back!

You’ll need to assemble a resistance movement and fight off the invaders so you can keep your homes safe!

#13 Road to Vostok

Many of the survival games we’ve shown you and will show you don’t exactly involve “realism” in all its many forms. But in Road to Vostok, the game tries to make the gameplay loop feel as real as possible.

In this case, you’ll have to deal with real-world health issues and damage, use weapons as they’re meant to be used, and deal with things like permadeath.

The world is alive, and you won’t know what you’ll find until you get to certain spots. Scavenge for supplies to extend your life, and if you do find people, consider trading with them to get even more stuff.

Build shelters, fight off dangers, and do whatever it takes to survive.

#12 Light No Fire

Traditionally, survival games are about “making it to the next day” and hoping it’s enough. But in Light No Fire, the title wants you to build a life for yourself alongside other players. You’ll be put in a world with fantasy settings but with familiar elements.

As you travel around, you’ll meet other players and get the chance to build up this world so you can survive in it. This is a living world. That means you’ll find biomes to check out, animals to deal with, and you’ll need to look around for resources and supplies to help your crew survive.

What kind of life will you build on this world? You’ll find out.

#11 ASCENT OF ASHES

Surviving this next world will be anything but easy, and that’s part of the point. ASCENT OF ASHES will put you in another post-apocalyptic world that has been invested with alien creatures and people willing to do anything to survive.

The game accurately depicts survival tactics and combat as you’ll have to deal with injuries as they happen and can not only scavenge for supplies but repair things like vehicles to get around.

How you live in this world will depend on your interactions. You can kill everything in sight or try to tame some of the aliens to help you. Just be aware of the potential dangers; they are numerous.

#10 Wanderlost

Huh, we haven’t had a survival game that’s featured zombies yet, have we? Let’s change that! Wanderlost is a cutely-rendered title that will throw you into a wilderness and expects you to survive. That shouldn’t be to hard, right?

Well, it will be given the zombies and other creatures that exist in this world. You’ll need to construct a home to protect yourself within and then slowly expand it via the resources you collect. As you venture deeper into the world, you’ll get access to more things, so don’t be afraid to roam!

Just remember, there are dangers everywhere, so bring some weapons to fight back!

#9 Enshrouded

Your world isn’t what it used to be. Greed has once again cost the people their homes and many lives. But you are one of the few who has the chance to change things and survive this sick planet.

In Enshrouded, you’ll begin with nothing, making it a true survival adventure. As you work your way through this world and its biomes, you’ll get what you need to survive and start to piece together what happened here and how things can change.

Build to your heart’s content, or craft things that will help you face the world’s many dangers. You can do what you want here, so have fun!

#8 Sand

We don’t like Sand, it’s course and irritating and, what’s that? Oh, have we already made this joke several times? Darn.

Anyway, in this game, you’ll be put into an alternate version of history where a massive empire ruled over several planets. But when disaster struck, and their prized world fell to the sandy depths, they left much behind to be found.

That’s where you and other players come in. You’ll go to the world and attempt to find the treasures and resources that were left behind. Plus, you’ll have a mech known as a Trampler that you can upgrade to help you on your journey.

Will you find what was lost?

#7 ALOFT

Ready to set sail? You might think that’s odd given the game’s name of “ALOFT,” but it’s an apt question. After all, in the title, you’re surviving on an island that is floating in the sky due to a hurricane that swirls your home and other islands around its vortex!

The only way to travel around this hurricane is to build upon your island a set of masts and sails and ride the winds to adventure! You can build your island however you want and then venture to other islands to see what they hold and what you can use to continue your adventure.

If you want, you can even build a flying wing for yourself and glide around!

#6 The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria

Our next game has an interesting twist on things because this tale is set after the events of J.R.R. Tolkien’s legendary trilogy of books.

In it, you’ll play as dwarves who are attempting to reclaim their land of Moria. Orcs and trolls drove them out, but with the fall of Sauron, it’s time to get back your land under the Misty Mountains!

You’ll travel through the caverns, search for remnants of your lost civilization, and attempt to rebuild! But with a procedurally generated land, you never know what will be out there. Prepare yourself for battle, and do what it takes to wipe out the invaders and restore your dwarven pride! In 2024 we’ll finally get this game on the Xbox platform.

#5 Nightingale

You might think that survival is hard in the many worlds we’ve shown you, but in Nightingale, you’re not trying to survive a singular world. Instead, you’re trying to survive numerous realms that you’re traveling through as you attempt to reach your destination.

Long story short, your home world has been sealed off, and you’re off in search of a realm where humanity is now residing. But getting to there won’t be easy when each new realm you enter will be full of awe-inspiring sights and terrible dangers.

You’ll need to craft weapons and work together with other players to survive what’s out there.

#4 S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl

A sad fact about S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl is that you should’ve already been able to play the game. However, given the situation with the nations that helped make this game and other factors, they felt it best to delay things.

But once the game arrives, you’ll have a riveting experience to undergo. The game takes place many years after another nuclear event went down in Chornobyl. Yeah, because the first one wasn’t enough, apparently!

You are one of the many people who will venture into the exclusion zone to harvest the wonders, riches, and mysteries of the place. But whether you survive the zone is another matter entirely.

#3 Dune: Awakening

At first, you might be put off by the idea that we’re showing you a game based on a movie. But we’re not! We’re showing you a video game based on a book that was eventually turned into several movies. Totally different!

Plus, this game isn’t based entirely on the plot of the books or films. Dune: Awakening will put you on the desert spice world of Arrakis and allows you to craft a tale that fits what you want to be. Will you be a hero to this world and others? Will you try to conquer and see what wonders await you?

The choice is yours, so choose your path and get started!

#2 ARK 2

We’ve shown you plenty of survival games on this list, but how many have Vin Diesel in them? Exactly! Just this one! ARK 2 will put you in a strange world you do no know how you arrived at. Your mission is not only to survive this crazy world but also to figure out the truth about all that is happening in it.

What’s happening on it? Well, a whole bunch of people are fighting it out. Humans riding dinosaurs and using sci-fi technology, that kind of thing. But we’re sure you’ll be fine on it! You have Vin Diesel to help you! He’s big on family.

#1 Frostpunk 2

In wintertime, the cold is what many people fear and hate the most. But in Frostpunk 2, things are much colder and much worse than you could’ve possibly imagined.

You’re thrust into a world where a great storm has caused the last city of humanity to be put on the brink. Your mission is to build this place back up and help the people who live in it. Unity is essential to survive, but that’s hard to do when everyone has different agendas and desires for what this city can be.

You’ll have to do a balancing act like never before to make it all work. Expand where you can, be smart with how you grow the city, and ensure the people’s actions don’t destroy everything you’ve built!'",climate,heatwave
"'Increased demand for water due to global population growth, coupled with the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, endangers our water security. Nonetheless, little is known about the relationship of water use by sectors and the occurrence of drought-heatwave events, particularly at the large scale. To unveil this issue, a group of researchers from the Department of Physical Geography from Utrecht University evaluated the responses of sectoral water use during droughts, heatwaves and compound (combined) events at a global scale. The study published in Environmental Research Letters shows that stronger sectoral water use responses are found for heatwaves compared to impacts during droughts.

The research is the first global study quantifying on sectoral water use responses under extremes droughts, heatwaves and compound events. Sectoral water use responses are understood as how the water use practices of sectors (namely domestic, irrigation, thermoelectric energy, manufacturing and livestock) are affected by the occurrence of droughts, heatwaves and compound events, which could lead them to increase or decrease their use of water or to show no particular reaction to these hydroclimatic extremes. A large amount of data of sectoral water use at global, country and local scales during the last 30 years were analysed. “We focused on the water used by various sectors, namely irrigation, livestock, domestic, energy and manufacturing, because we expected particular responses to the occurrence of different extreme events” says Gabriel Cardenas Belleza, PhD candidate at Utrecht University and lead author of this publication.

The analysis shows that extreme events over the last thirty years had substantial impacts on water use patterns, but these responses highly differ per sector and region across the world. “Socio-economic factors and public water management plans strongly influence water use responses, and even more so during extreme events. For instance, while Western continental United States decreases its water use during extremes, the central US increases it”, says Cardenas. In addition, the results reveal that the domestic and irrigation sectors, in general, have the highest priority for water use worldwide, however, stricter measures are taken in favour of the domestic sector during extremes.

The analysis also shows that heatwaves and compound drought-heatwave events overall have stronger impacts on water use in comparison to solely droughts. “Heatwaves and compound events can lead to higher water use as a consequence of the temporary increase in water demand under high temperatures, which can still be satisfied due to the short duration of such extremes, compared to longer-lasting events like droughts” says Cardenas.

The results of the study demonstrate the urgency to collect more water use data to better understand the implications of extreme events and climate change on different water use sectors and for improved assessments of future water scarcity. “Our research provides a first step to evaluate multi-sectoral water use behaviour during extremes. However, more local-scale information from data-scarce areas, like Africa and parts of Asia and South America, is needed to better understand sectoral water use behaviour and improve water management strategies”.

"'The death toll from China’s most powerful earthquake in years has risen to 149, with two people still missing after the tremor hit northwestern parts of the country last week.

The 6.2-magnitude quake struck a remote mountainous area between Gansu and Qinghai provinces on Dec. 18, reducing homes to rubble and triggering heavy mudslides that inundated two villages in Qinghai province.

State broadcaster CCTV said Monday the death toll in Donghai city in Qinghai has risen by one, to 32, and rescuers were still searching for two missing people. In neighboring Gansu, authorities had reported 117 dead.

Nearly 1,000 were injured and more than 14,000 homes were destroyed in China’s deadliest earthquake in nine years.

Primary schools in Jishishan county in Gansu resumed classes in tents on Monday, state media reported. Local authorities said they would use the upcoming winter break to repair damaged schools and erect temporary structures so that classes could resume as normal in the spring semester.

Authorities also rushed to erect temporary housing units for survivors facing temperatures well below freezing. CGTN, the state broadcaster’s international arm, said the first batch of 500 temporary housing units had been built for residents in Meipo, a village in Gansu, on Friday night.

More than 87,000 people have been resettled after the quake.

The tremor caused economic losses estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars in the agricultural and fisheries industries, according to state media.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Saturday visited several villages in Gansu and a county in Qinghai and urged authorities to improve living conditions for the survivors, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Li said the top priority of relief efforts was to make sure people stay warm and safe in winter.

Funerals were held throughout the week, some following the Muslim traditions of much of the population in the affected area.

Most of China’s earthquakes strike in the western part of the country, including Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, as well as the Xinjiang region and Tibet.

The country’s deadliest earthquake in recent years was a 7.9-magnitude tremor in 2008 that left nearly 90,000 dead or presumed dead and devastated towns and schools in Sichuan province, leading to a yearslong effort to rebuild with more resistant materials.'",climate,earthquake
"'PUTRAJAYA, Oct 19 — The Department of Environment (DoE) has been directed to increase enforcement and daily patrols in areas with the potential of open burning occurring, said Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change (NRECC) Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

This follows the Kota Tinggi forest fire incident on October 15 involving 32 hectares of forest. Seventy per cent fire has been extinguished.

“All landowners have been advised to closely monitor all areas which easily and frequently catch fire,"" he said in a statement today.

Nik Nazmi said monitoring and observation carried out on the forest fire incident found that there was still smoke coming from the land's surface, and enforcement action will be taken against the landowner after an official search is made at the land office later.

He said the haze issue in the country was also mentioned in the Cabinet meeting yesterday, and he has communicated with the Education Ministry and Ministry of Health (MoH) to temporarily stop outdoor activities due to the deterioration of air quality in the country.

This was in line with the National Haze Action Plan (PTJK) for air quality to be constantly monitored to ensure the agencies involved in haze disaster management can take more quick and responsive action.

Among the actions under the PTJK are activating the Disaster Management Committee which will be mobilised by the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) when the Air Pollutant Index (API) reading exceeds 150 for a period of more than 24 hours; stopping all activities outside the classrooms when the API reading exceeds 100; closing schools, kindergartens and nurseries when the API reading exceeds 200.

This is in line with the standard operating procedures (SOP) set by the MoH which applies to all and must be followed to avoid untoward incidents. Apart from this, cloud seeding operations will also be implemented if needed, he said.

At 1pm today, Klang in Selangor recorded an unhealthy API reading of 153.

According to Nik Nazmi, although only Klang recorded an unhealthy API reading, the trend of air quality throughout the week showed that several areas often recorded unhealthy readings, especially in Peninsular Malaysia due to the movement of haze.

The Regional Haze Map, released by the Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) on October 18, also found that the current wind movement in the southern part of Asean is from east to south-east, whereas in the next few days, the southern part of Asean will receive higher rainfall which will lead to a reduction in hotspots and haze.

In dealing with the haze issue, Nik Nazmi said Malaysia has entered into a bilateral agreement with Indonesia on haze prevention efforts on a government-to-government basis under the framework of the Asean Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution.

He said the NRECC will also examine the propriety of enacting the Bill on Transboundary Haze to deal with the haze crisis in the country.

It includes the feasibility of the law to be enacted, diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries as well as the implementation of similar acts by other countries to ensure that there is no waste of resources in enacting the act. He added that the NRECC could also examine the mechanism of instruments or other appropriate legislation to deal with the matter.

In facing the haze crisis, the public is urged to always be careful and sensitive to the air quality level in their respective areas and to take preventive steps to reduce the health effects of haze, including avoiding outdoor physical activities in order to reduce exposure to unhealthy air.

Those involved in open burning activities can be fined not exceeding RM500,000 or imprisoned for a period not exceeding five years or both as stipulated under Section 29(A), Environmental Quality Act 1974. They can also be fined a maximum compound of RM2,000 for each offence. — Bernama'",climate,heatwave
"'Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner (11) dunks against UNLV during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023, in Henderson, Nev. (AP Photo/John Locher)

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Creighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner returned to the eighth-ranked Bluejays’ game against Alabama at the start of the second half after injuring his right ankle.

Kalkbrenner turned his ankle while running back on defense seven minutes into the game. He went to the locker room for the rest of the half but was back on the court after doing some jogging and stretching drills.

The 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner is the Bluejays' second-leading scorer, two-time Big East defensive player of the year and one of the country’s premier rim protectors.

Fredrick King, Isaac Traudt and Jasen Green took over in the middle during Kalkbrenner's absence.

"'The Liberty turned to the WNBA’s 2023 regular-season MVP with their game — and season — on the line, but she couldn’t come through.

In the final moments of the 70-69 loss to a depleted Aces squad Wednesday night, Breanna Stewart was given the ball out of a timeout with 8.8 seconds left and looked for a shot in the paint, but was denied by Alysha Clark.

Stewart passed the ball off to Betnijah Laney, who found Courtney Vandersloot in the corner. But Vandersloot’s 3-point try was off to the right at the buzzer, leaving the Aces as the first back-to-back WNBA champions in 21 years.

“I put the ball in the hands of the MVP because we trust her. And it just didn’t work out today,” Liberty head coach Sandy Brondello said after her team was beaten 3-1 in the best-of-five series. “It ended up with Breanna at the end, so it was just her trying to make a play from there. So, I [would] still do it again. That’s the right call.”

It was a last effort for Stewart to deliver after a dismal night. But she failed and the sorrow could be easily read on her face.

Breanna Stewart was forced to pass the ball on the final possession of the Liberty’s 70-69 season-ending loss to the Aces in the WNBA Finals. Michelle Farsi/New York Post

“High,” Stewart said when asked about her level of disappointment.

The Aces had Stewart’s number. They held the two-time MVP, two-time WNBA champ, and five-time All-Star to 3-for-17 shooting from the field for a mere 10 points. They also held Jonquel Jones to six points on 3-for-8 shooting.

The champions owned the paint, scoring 44 points against the Liberty’s 24.

“We knew what their game plan was going to be to like chuck it up and make it difficult and that’s exactly what happened,” Stewart said. “Couldn’t get anything to drop and I mean, credit to Vegas. They played well, but we wanted to, obviously, push it to Game 5.”

The 10 points were the fewest Stewart scored in a game this postseason.

“I think they would just throw whatever defense they had at us and make sure it was ugly,” Stewart said. “Sometimes we lost our flow and our ball movement, but [we were] confident behind all the shots that we got, and they just didn’t go in.”'",sports,basketball
"'The Miami Marlins are hiring Tampa Bay Rays general manager Peter Bendix as their new head of baseball operations to replace Kim Ng, a source confirmed to the Miami Herald.

The Athletic first reported the news, which the Marlins have not confirmed, Sunday evening.

Bendix, 38, has been with the Rays since 2009 when he started as an intern. He worked his way up to general manager ahead of the 2022 season and has served as the No. 2 in Tampa Bay’s baseball operations department the past two seasons under Erik Neander, who previously held the GM job before being promoted to president of baseball operations.

Bendix has worked in various roles for Tampa Bay’s baseball operations prior to becoming general manager, including six seasons leading the Rays’ baseball development department and serving as vice president of baseball development from 2020-21. His other titles, according to his Rays bio, have included assistant to baseball operations, coordinator of baseball research and development, and director of baseball development.

Once the hire is official, it will end a nearly month-long search to replace Ng, who was the Marlins’ general manager for the past three seasons.

Ng, who declined her side of a mutual option to stay for the 2024 season, said at the time of her departure on Oct. 16 that Marlins principal owner and chairman Bruce Sherman had a plan to “reshape the Baseball Operations department” — which ultimately boiled down to hiring a president of baseball operations above her — and said “it became apparent that we were not completely aligned on what that should look like.”

The decision came after the Marlins made the playoffs in 2023 for the first time in a full campaign (excluding the pandemic-shortened 2020 season) since winning the World Series in 2003. Miami was swept in the best-of-3 wild card round by the Philadelphia Phillies.

The Marlins overall went 220-266 in her three seasons at the helm, but went 84-78 last season after two sub-70-win seasons to begin her tenure.

Marlins decline options for Barnes, Cueto

The Marlins on Sunday declined club options for right-handed pitchers Matt Barnes and Johnny Cueto. Barnes and Cueto will now become free agents.

These decisions come after first baseman Josh Bell on Saturday exercised his $16.5 million player option for the 2024 season to stay with Miami and outfielder/designated hitter Jorge Soler on Thursday opted out of his deal, which would have paid him $13 million to stay in Miami.

Barnes and Cueto were both acquired ahead of the 2023 season — Barnes via trade, Cueto as a free agent — and neither lived up to expectations.

Barnes, who will be paid a $2.25 million buyout instead of $8 million for the 2024 season, came to Miami via a trade with the Boston Red Sox to be a high-leverage righty out of the bullpen. He appeared in just 24 games, pitching to a 5.48 ERA with a 1.64 walks and hits per inning pitched rate before undergoing season-ending hip surgery in July.

Miami’s current crop of right-handed relief pitchers includes JT Chargois, George Soriano and Anthony Bender, the latter of whom missed the 2023 season while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.

As for Cueto, Miami signed him to a $6 million deal with a $10.5 million option or $2.5 million buyout for the 2024 season with the hope he would be able to eat innings and be a veteran presence for a talented-yet-young Marlins rotation.

Cueto wound up pitching just one inning in the first half of the season before being sidelined by a biceps injury in his season debut — and then rolling his ankle during his first attempt at a rehab assignment. He alternated between the rotation and the bullpen during the second half but struggled overall, pitching to a 6.02 ERA over 52 1/3 innings in 13 appearances (10 starts).

Miami’s rotation will be tested in 2024. Sandy Alcantara, the team’s ace and 2022 NL Cy Young Award winner, will not pitch next season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. Miami’s rotation as the roster currently stands looks as if it will include five of the following six: Lefties Jesus Luzardo, Braxton Garrett, Trevor Rogers and Ryan Weathers along with righties Eury Perez and Edward Cabrera. Max Meyer, Miami’s first-round pick in 2020, could also factor into the competition after missing last season while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.

It’s worth noting that Cabrera is out of minor-league options.

Another pitcher to watch that Miami will have to make a decision on before the season: Sixto Sanchez, who has been sidelined by injuries each of the past three years and is also out of minor-league options.'",sports,baseball

Appeals launched

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) on Friday launched a $14.4 million humanitarian appeal to provide shelters, heaters and warm clothes to survivors sleeping out in the open, ahead of the approaching bitter winter.

The UN agency will also provide legal assistance and counselling, including helping recover and process key documents so that households, including refugees and internally displaced returnees, can exercise their civil rights.

The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) issued an initial appeal earlier this week for $20 million to deliver emergency and trauma care for newborns and children, repair schools and healthcare facilities, and provide psychosocial and mental health support to children and families.

Vulnerable families

According to the UN agency, communities in the region were already reeling from the effects of years of conflict, insecurity and climate-induced disasters.

“These deprivations have now collided, creating an unprecedented humanitarian emergency for children,” said Rushnan Murtaza, acting UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan.

“UNICEF and our partners have been on the ground since day one, providing life-saving assistance for children, but we need additional support to bring children the healthcare, protection, and clean water they desperately need.”

Needs and response

UN agencies and partners, meanwhile, continue relief efforts and assess the scale of damage, following Wednesday’s aftershock.

OCHA said that damage to heath facilities is of particular concern, as over 580,000 people have been cut off from medical care. Several schools have also sustained damage and are not operational.

In response, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) supplied over 95 tons of food rations and food commodities to thousands of affected people, while UNICEF, UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) delivered shelter, food and non-food assistance to over 550 families in 15 affected villages.'",climate,earthquake
"'Real1, Formerly WWE's Enzo Amore, Shares Thoughts On AEW's Ticket Sales

Real1, formerly known as Enzo Amore in WWE, has jumped to the defense of AEW following dwindling ticket sales for some of their shows.

A recent photo posted on social from an AEW show sparked a wave of criticism aimed at AEW when an entire side of the arena appeared empty. Real1 took to social media to explain why recent AEW shows haven't sold well, blaming high ticket prices and a lack of promotion as the main reasons.

""When it comes AEW crowds and ticket sales, there's a lot of bad faith takes and those trolling with pictures with empty seats. Here's some facts that play into that 1) lack of promoting. Whenever AEW promotes their show like what they did for Grand Slam (promoting on the news, etc) tickets move fast. They have to do this more. There's not enough,"" said the former WWE star. ""2) ticket prices. The more u raise your prices, the more likely people can't go. Not a lot of people have that much money. Go back to the prices in the beginning of AEW.""

AEW ticket prices for upcoming shows vary, with tickets for some shows starting at $24, while other venues begin as high as $59, as per information from Ticketsmarter.

Real1 also argued that AEW repeatedly visiting the same cities could have led to fans becoming burnt out on the product. He cited how the promotion hosts multiple shows within the same week in the same city, potentially contributing to a decline in ticket sales. He further added that there's nothing wrong with the AEW product, and pointed to the aforementioned factors for empty seats in AEW arenas recently.

Ticket sales could pick up in the weeks to come as AEW prepares for its next pay-per-view, Full Gear, which will take place at the Kia Forum in California on November 18, 2023.'",sports,tennis

"'Your Oven Is The Key To Cooking Sunny Side Up Eggs En Masse

Do you need to make a whole bunch of sunny-side up eggs all at once? Whether you've got a little league team to feed, a super large family, or a big bunch of brunching friends, there's a clever method you'll want to keep in mind! Put that frying pan away and step away from the stove. All you need is a standard 11-inch by 17-inch (or 9-inch by 13-inch) sheet pan and your trusty oven to make a dozen eggs all at the same time.

If you've never made eggs in the oven before then you might be amazed that it is even possible. But it's true — the oven is a great way to cook all kinds of eggs, not just quiches and frittatas. Even celebrity chefs like Jaime Oliver recommend it for getting a whole lot of eggs served up quickly. Not only will everyone be able to eat at the same time, but you'll save yourself the mess of splattered oil or butter from frying all of those eggs.'",sports,baseball

"'Serbia's Novak Djokovic reacts after defeating Spain's Carlos Alcaraz in their singles semifinal tennis match of the ATP World Tour Finals at the Pala Alpitour, in Turin, Italy, Saturday, Nov. 18, 2023. (AP Photo/Antonio Calanni)

TURIN, Italy (AP) — Top-ranked Novak Djokovic will be bidding for a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title when he takes on home favorite Jannik Sinner in Sunday’s final.

Djokovic took less than 90 minutes to beat Carlos Alcaraz 6-3, 6-2 in a semifinal match between the top two ranked players on Saturday night, after Sinner had earlier dispatched Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-1.

The 36-year-old Djokovic is currently tied with Roger Federer on six titles at the season-ending tournament for the year’s top eight players, while Sinner is the first Italian to reach the final.

However, Sinner recorded his first-ever victory over Djokovic earlier this week and the Serbian will also have to contend again with a passionate, partisan crowd.

“He’s been playing fantastic tennis, arguably the best tennis of his life,” Djokovic said. “We played a very close match the other night. The atmosphere was unbelievable, electric really. I don’t expect anything less than that, probably even louder than what we had in the group-stage matchup.

“It’s the final, I’ve been in this situation before many times. I’m really happy with the way I’m feeling, the way I’m playing, so hopefully I can deliver my ‘A’ game tomorrow.”

Djokovic had plenty of support in Turin on Saturday, with many chanting his name between points.

Alcaraz and Djokovic had played each other four times previously and won two each. Djokovic won their most recent encounter in the final in Cincinnati in August, while Alcaraz beat the Serb in five sets in the Wimbledon final.

The latest battle between the two never hit those levels of drama, however, as Djokovic clinically took his chances after recovering from having to stave off two break points in the opening game.

“I approached the match with the right attitude, the right mentality, and I knew from the very first point it was going to be greatly intense,” Djokovic said. “He had break points right away, 15-40 in the first game.

“That’s Carlos. He always brings out his best in these kinds of matches and starts with a lot of high quality tennis and intensity. You’ve got to match that, try to weather the storm, and I did that.”

Djokovic nosed in front in the eighth game as Alcaraz — playing in his first ATP Finals — saved one break point but then hit a backhand into the net to leave Djokovic serving for the set. He duly did so to love, seeing it out with an ace.

Djokovic had won his past 15 matches after taking the opener and the writing appeared on the wall for Alcaraz when his opponent went a set and a break up early in the second set.

Alcaraz had the chance to level the set in the sixth game but Djokovic saved two break points, the second with a sumptuous crosscourt forehand that had the crowd roaring its approval. Djokovic lapped it up, raising his arms out, before cupping his hand to his ear and nodding his head and then pumping his fist.

Instead, it was Djokovic who broke in the very next game and then duly served for the set.

PERFECT SINNER

Sinner has won all four of his matches at the ATP Finals, including that mesmerizing victory over Djokovic earlier this week.

Sinner has been fervently backed by the fans in Turin — with the orange-clad “Carota Boys” ever present — and the 22-year-old raised his arms to the joyous crowd after serving the match out to love against 2020 champion Medvedev.

“It is a privilege to have this kind of pressure,” Sinner said. “The crowd has given me so much energy.

“It was a very difficult match. He started better than me, then I somehow managed to get the break and then I felt a bit better.”

Sinner is already up to No. 4 in the rankings — the highest an Italian man has risen since Adriano Panatta nearly a half-century ago.

Sinner’s win over the third-ranked Medvedev also saw him become the Italian with the most victories over top-five players (10), breaking Panatta’s record.

Medvedev had won all six of his matches against Sinner before last month but the Italian had ended that streak with victories in the finals at Beijing and Vienna.

The nerves appeared to be setting in for Medvedev after Sinner broke his serve in the second game of the decider and moments later the Russian hurled his racket at the boards after losing a scintillating rally, before remonstrating with the crowd as the boos rang out.

Medvedev managed to avoid a complete meltdown but Sinner dominated and broke again in the sixth game before serving out to love.

Dec. 28 (UPI) -- Flooding and evacuation warnings are in effect in multiple California counties as dangerously high waves pounded the coast Thursday.

Marin Country residents were ordered to evacuate Thursday morning due to possible flooding at Stinson Beach after forecasters predicted severe weather conditions in the North Bay area. Evacuation warnings extended to Santa Cruz County and Capitola Village through the afternoon.

The National Weather Service issued a coastal flood advisory for the Coastal North Bay and a high surf warning for the central and northern Californian coastline through 3 a.m. Friday.

Despite multiple evacuation warnings, residents and tourists couldn't help but stare in awe at the biggest surf to hit the California coastline since January.

""It's really beautiful. It's just breathtaking. It shows you the strength of Mother Nature,"" Mike Buyer told the San Francisco Chronicle from Pacifica, where high waves surged up into the Pacific Hotel Breeze parking lot and rolled high along the pier.

Thursday's swell also drew highly skilled surfers at Mavericks Beach near Princeton-by-the-Sea, where the waves can climb to 50 or 60 feet tall. Surfer Grant Washburn, who has surfed Mavericks for decades, said the waves were ""historic and a little scary -- a lot scary.""

The high surf also cause serious damage and prompted multiple water rescues along the San Luis Obispo Coast. The flooding overturned a pickup truck in Arroyo Grande Creek and washed RVs into the surf line at the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area.

Thursday's swell couldn't scare away highly skilled surfers who flocked to famed surfing attraction Mavericks Beach (pictured, 2014) to catch waves as high as 60 feet. File Photo by Terry Schmitt/UPI

""The waves and high tide were just overwhelming the beach,"" Oceano resident Ed Collins said.

Cal Fire, Port San Luis Harbor Patrol, San Luis Ambulance and a California Highway Patrol helicopter all responded to an incident in which a hiker fell off a cliff at Pirate's Cove and fell into the water Thursday morning. Additional units were requested to deal with ""potential complexity with the waves,"" according to The Tribune. The hiker was rescued from the cliff having sustained only minor injuries.

It's already been a big week for California, and there is more forecasted to come. Thursday's high tide hit northern California right after it faced southerly wind and stormy conditions on Wednesday. Southern California is expected to dodge the poor conditions hitting the northern coastline. Another swell of the same size class is anticipated for this weekend, with a swell direction that might impact the southern coastline more than the northern.'",climate,flood

JDRF fundraiser walk

JDRF will host its annual Piedmont Triad Fall One Walk and T1D (Type 1 diabetes) Day in Kernersville at Triad Park’s Amphitheater on Oct. 28. The theme for this year’s event is “Dancing through the Decades: Moving Forward as One,” which participants are using to jumpstart their fundraising efforts and spark their creativity as they design their Walk Team t-shirts.

The event, presented by The Carroll Companies, Truist and FOX8, will encompass two Walk times (9:15 a.m. and 11:15 a.m.), with short Opening Ceremonies preceding each Walk. Between the two Walks, from 10 to 11 a.m., participants with type 1 may take part in a T1D Procession; all attendees may march across the stage in a T-shirt parade, play games, enjoy kids’ activities, meet T1D pharma and medical technology reps, and learn about JDRF’s recent research advancements and advocacy efforts.

The morning will be led by 2023 JDRF Piedmont Triad Walk Champions Mallory and Conrad Graham, and their daughters, Anna Claire (9) and Lucy (5). Lucy was diagnosed with T1D almost three years ago, at the age of 2 ½, and the Grahams’ world was turned upside down. As Conrad said, “We were extremely shocked, scared and overwhelmed. We had no idea what life was going to look like for Lucy—and our entire family—going forward.”

From the moment Lucy was diagnosed, Mallory and Conrad set out to engage everyone they knew in turning Type One into Type None. They formed the Lucy Goose Walk Team, setting their sights on being the Piedmont Triad’s top Family Team in 2022. The Lucy Goose Team finished third in fundraising last year, making them even more determined to capture the top spot in 2023.

Water shortage response plan

Greensboro wants to hear residents’ thoughts about how Greensboro responds when its public drinking water supply system is low, affecting water availability for human consumption, sanitation, health and fire protection. The procedures listed in this plan represent the city’s formal response to such water shortages. State rules require systems to publish the plan for public comment every five years. No substantive changes have been made. The city’s draft 2023 City of Greensboro Water Shortage Response Plan is at www.greensboro-nc.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/57318.

Residents may share comments about the plan through Nov. 18. Email Michael.Borchers@greensboro-nc.gov or Scott.Jewell@greensboro-nc.gov or call 336-373-2494 or 336-373-7900.

Greensboro is located at the top of the Cape Fear Watershed and depends on surface water stored in reservoirs for its water supply, which makes the city more vulnerable than many utilities to periods of drought. For this reason, the city’s WSRP is based on the percentage of available surface water storage in its reservoirs.

Guilford Metro 911 survey

Beginning Oct. 25, city of Greensboro and Guilford County residents will be some of the first in the state to use a new community engagement and feedback solution after an interaction with Guilford Metro 911. This new service uses text messaging to contact some 911 callers that have recently reported or been involved in non-life threatening incidents.

These text messages are sent hours or even days, after the incident and will ask residents to take a quick survey about their experience with the 911 Center. It will also allow residents to provide their own comments, feedback and words of gratitude after receiving public safety service.

With PowerEngage, text message surveys are sent to those whose cell phone number is recorded as part of a call for service. Text messages containing the survey should come from a 336-344-9726 or 336-438-2859 number.

Residents that do not want to participate can simply not respond to the text message. As with all texts, anyone may reply with STOP and that will opt them out of all future text surveys from the department.

These surveys should not be used to report any type of emergency. As always, call 911 for any emergency.

Community open house events

The High Point 2045 Comprehensive Plan initiative will offer two final community open house events from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Nov. 1 at the High Point Museum at 1859 Lexington Ave. and from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Nov. 2 in the Morgan Room at the High Point Public Library at 901 N. Main St.

Community members are invited to attend either drop-in session to review the results of the participation to date and to give feedback as the city’s proposed long-term growth plan takes final shape.

Both open houses are open to anyone who lives, works and plays in High Point and will have no formal presentation.

The High Point 2045 Comprehensive Plan initiative began in February 2023 to engage the public in creating a long-range decision-making guide that establishes the general direction for policymaking and public investment for the next 20 years or more.

Through a variety of engagement efforts, including in-person open houses and online surveys, more than 1,000 people have participated in the process. They weighed in on outcomes for the major focus points the plan must include and on future growth and development scenarios. Feedback received from the final open houses will be used to clarify and formalize strategies to achieve the community’s goals.

"'DES MOINES, Iowa (Gray Iowa Capitol Bureau) - Most of Iowa remains in a drought. It’s most extreme in northeast Iowa. Despite snowfall over the Thanksgiving weekend, experts say it’s not going to help very much.

Greg Wandrey with the Iowa Corn Growers Association says despite the drought, corn fared pretty well this year. “Many of the farmers that I talked to that were harvesting corn were surprised at where the grain came from. They said, ‘I don’t know where this crop came from’. But in many cases, they were actually harvesting above normal yields,” Wandrey said.

Soybeans didn’t fare as well. “If you remember, we had a week or so of 100-degree temperatures at the end of August, and some agronomists think that took the top off some of the soybean yields,” Wandrey said.

Even though the summer heat is now long gone, Wandrey says the drought isn’t going away anytime soon. “The drought is roaring like it has been for the last three years. You know, typically we would get some rainfall and snow cover by this time of year,” Wandrey said.

Most of Iowa saw at least an inch of snowfall over the weekend, but how much did it help the drought? “Two inches of snow is about two tenths of an inch of rain so no, it’s not doing much,” Wandrey said.

Wandrey says this fall was also dry, but there’s time for conditions to improve. “If we could get some rain in you know, February and March, you know, as long as it’s not too much because more often than not too much rain or too much moisture in the soil is more detrimental to farmers than not enough especially as they try to get into the fields early as possible,” Wandrey said.

Wandrey says later in the week, the ground should warm up and what little snowfall we got should be able to get into the ground.

Steve Cooper says he was ""embarrassed"" to hear Nottingham Forest fans noisily chanting his name at Craven Cottage even when his side had been well beaten — as he felt he did not deserve such vociferous backing, after overseeing a 5-0 defeat.

The Reds head coach was still being loudly heralded by the travelling support even when they trailed 3-0 and 4-0 in the capital, while his name was also loudly chanted after the final whistle, at the end of what was one of the worst performances of his tenure.

Cooper says he was grateful to Forest fans for their continued support and acknowledged the relationship he has built with them during his tenure — but felt that their backing was undeserved on this occasion.

“It was embarrassing. I don’t deserve it. I am very grateful, you know that. It is unique, I know. But I just wish it was not the case, because what they showed outwardly, is the opposite of what they will be feeling inwardly,” said Cooper, who remains under significant pressure amid a run of one win in 11 Premier League games.

""Any criticism that comes from our supporters, you guys (the media) and the wider game, I have to accept that. I take responsibility for that. Please do not write anything different than that. It is down to me. I take ownership of that. But I felt embarrassed, purely because I did not deserve that (vocal backing from the stands).

“I know how I feel about them and the club and what it has done for me. But I cannot get the game out of my head. I heard it and I am grateful for it. But it is embarrassing to think I could get that reception on the back of what they have seen tonight, which is ultimately my responsibility.”

It felt as though fans were offering a thank you to the man who lead them back into the Premier League for the first time in 23 years, in the knowledge that his position is precarious. And his job security will not have been helped by a dismal performance.

Cooper was critical of his players, questioning their determination levels and insisted they go over to fans after the final whistle, expecting them to receive a far more hostile reception than they did.

“We should actually have got a very different reception to the one we got. But I wanted to make sure we got in front of the fans to take whatever was coming,” said Cooper

“And it should be me first. That is why I went to the front, it has to be on me. People should look at me first. You should write about me first, rather than anyone else. I accept that. I just wanted to say sorry to them; to acknowledge that we had let them down.”'",sports,soccer

"'ALEXANDRIA, La. (KALB) - The State Fire Marshal’s Office has reported a brush fire in the Alexandria area that has caused at least one death.

SFM said the brush fire was reported to authorities around 1:30 p.m. in the 6100 block of LA 488, or the Twin Bridges Road area.

As Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry crews were battling the resulting forest fire and the fire department was trying to put out the field where the fire originated, firefighters discovered a man’s body. SFM told us it is believed the person killed was burning hay bales and when the fire started to spread, they tried to get it under control and possibly died after getting overcome by the smoke.

"'After spending the first four-plus seasons of his career with the Washington Nationals, Soto was traded to the Padres in August 2022. Soto made two All-Star teams with Washington, won a Home Run Derby and two Silver Slugger awards, claimed a batting title and helped lead the Nationals to a World Series title during his time in the nation's capital.

Despite adding the 25-year-old to an already-loaded lineup and roster, San Diego fell short of World Series aspirations last year, dropping a five-game NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies.

The Padres continued their spending spree following the 2022 season by adding former Boston Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts on an 11-year, $280 million contract in Dec. 2022. Bogaerts and Soto were joined by third baseman Manny Machado and converted outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. in a stacked starting nine this summer, but the Padres ended up being one of the biggest disappointments in MLB this season.

The club was 62-73 heading into the final month of the campaign and despite a solid September, still finished only 82-80, in third place in the NL West and outside of the playoff picture.

Soto was the only member of the team to play in all 162 regular-season games. He led the league in walks for the third straight year (132) and paced the squad in runs scored (97), home runs (career-high 35), RBI (109), on-base percentage (.410), slugging percentage (.519), OPS (.929) and total bases (295). He also made his third All-Star team over the summer.

Soto has dodged trade rumors for the better part of the past year, being connected to big-market teams such as the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees, among others. He'll become a free agent in 2025.'",sports,baseball
"'Iga Swiatek, of Poland, holds up her trophy after her victory over Jessica Pegula, of the United States, in the women's singles final of the WTA Finals tennis championships, in Cancun, Mexico, Monday, Nov. 6, 2023. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano)

CANCUN, Mexico (AP) — Right after relinquishing the No. 1 ranking two months ago, Iga Swiatek couldn't help but worry about trying to regain it.

“It's hard not to think about stuff like that,” she explained.

And then Swiatek realized it was better to set that sort of thing aside and, instead, simply focus on playing her best tennis — and her best is better than anyone else's at the moment. Swiatek earned her first WTA Finals title and clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking by overwhelming Jessica Pegula 6-1, 6-0 on Monday in the latest in a series of dominant performances.

“Today was like a highlight of this mental (approach) — just being narrow with your head, only thinking about the right stuff,” said Swiatek, a 22-year-old from Poland who is the youngest WTA Finals champion since Petra Kvitova was 21 in 2011.

Swiatek went 5-0 at the tour’s season-closing championship, winning all 10 sets she played and ceding a total of just 20 games. That's the fewest by the winner at the event for the top eight women in tennis since the round-robin format returned in 2003.

“She clearly really wanted that ranking,"" Pegula said. ""I mean, you could tell by the way she was competing here. ... She was, like today, crushing people.”

Swiatek extended her winning streak to 11 matches and improved to 68-11 in 2023 with six trophies, including her fourth career Grand Slam title at the French Open in June.

Pegula called it “an amazing year.”

This victory allows Swiatek to return to No. 1, a spot she held from April 2022 until this September, when Aryna Sabalenka overtook her after the U.S. Open. In Cancun, Swiatek defeated Sabalenka in a semifinal that began Saturday, was suspended by rain, then finished on Sunday.

Pegula, a 29-year-old American, hadn't dropped a set entering Monday.

By beating No. 1 Sabalenka and No. 4 Elena Rybakina in the group stage, eliminating her doubles partner, No. 3 Coco Gauff, in the semifinals and taking on No. 2 Swiatek, Pegula became the first woman to face each of the top four players in the world at one event since the start of the WTA rankings in 1975.

But Pegula’s nine-match winning streak was stopped emphatically by Swiatek.

Swiatek finished with more winners, 9-6, and far fewer unforced errors, 23-6. She broke Pegula five times while only facing one break point herself — and it came as Swiatek served for the match in the last game.

Swiatek won 25 of 36 points in the first set, and 26 of 36 in the second.

“It just was one of those days where I felt like I was going for too much,” Pegula said. “And she was just playing super solid.”

When it ended, Swiatek dropped to her back, then sat up and yelled. Some spectators waved red-and-white Polish flags. During the trophy presentation, fans showered her with chants of “Iga!”

The final was played under a mostly blue sky and with far less wind than players were forced to contend with throughout the week. And, most importantly, there wasn’t a drop of rain.

Laura Siegemund of Germany and Vera Zvonareva of Russia won the doubles title by beating Nicole Melichar-Martinez of the U.S. and Ellen Perez of Australia 6-4, 6-4.

The singles and doubles title matches both originally were scheduled to be contested Sunday, then were pushed back after a series of showers affected play.

“It hasn't hasn't been the easiest week,” Pegula told the crowd, “for any of us.”

"'ASHEVILLE - A fire sparked by a traffic accident along Interstate 40 in Haywood County continues to grow, increasing about 44% in size overnight, according to a Nov. 19 news statement from the North Carolina Forest Incident Management Team.

The Black Bear Fire, which started Nov. 16, is now 1,720 acres and is 0% contained, is burning in Pisgah National Forest near the Tennessee border, but a rainstorm expected the night of Nov. 20 might go a long way toward tamping down the smoke and flames.

While I-40 remains open, drivers should expect delays from both directions, and might experience reduced visibility on I-40 due to fires in the area. For public and firefighter safety, the Appalachian Trail is closed from I-40 to Max Patch. Road closures are in effect for Cold Springs Road and Brown Gap Road. Check current road conditions at drivenc.gov. For more information on Black Bear fire, visit https://inciweb.nwcg.gov.

Smoke from the Black Bear Fire, which is now burning 1,720 acres in the Pisgah National Forest in Haywood County near the Tennessee border, can be seen in the distance.

Primary containment lines have been identified around the Black Bear Fire, using I-40 on the southwest, the Appalachian Trail from I-40 to Groundhog Creek Shelter along the north, and Forest Road 3580 on the east, south to I-40, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

""Groundhog Creek drainage is being scouted as a better eastern containment line to further limit fire spread potential. Containment line work along the Appalachian Trail will consist of raking away forest floor litter and removing fallen trees, much like normal trail maintenance, to minimize impacts along the National Scenic Trail,"" according to the agency's Nov. 19 post.

Rain is expected to start in the Western North Carolina mountains around midnight Nov. 20, gradually increasing across the night into the day Nov. 21, then decreasing Tuesday night and ending Wednesday morning, according to Doug Outlaw, meteorologist with the National Weather Service, based in Greer, South Carolina.

The total amount of rain expected for Asheville is about an inch. Places further south including Hendersonville, should receive 1.5-2 inches of rain, and Brevard and Lake Toxaway will see from 1.5 to 3 inches, Outlaw said.

Along the Tennessee border, including Marshall, 3/4 of an inch to an inch are expected.

""All the fires should be extinguished by Tuesday night, I would think, with all this rain. At the very lease, firefighters should make a lot of progress and have everything under control,"" Outlaw said.

The rain forecast is a welcome relief from the drought that has been strangling much of Western North Carolina this fall. So far in November, the Asheville area has only received .15 of an inch so far, which is 2 inches below normal, Outlaw said.

Stronger winds from the southeast with gusts in excess of 30 mph can be expected at the highest peaks near the North Carolina-Tennessee border Monday evening. Other areas in the region are expected to see an increase in southerly winds on Tuesday with gusts in excess of 30 mph.

But since Jan. 1, the area is 12.64 inches below normal rainfall to his point in the year, which should be 43.82 inches by now, he said.

The Asheville area is in moderate drought, while other parts of Buncombe and Madison counties are in sever drought, and Henderson County is in extreme drought.

The next chance of rain after Tuesday is coming up on Saturday, Nov. 25. High temperatures on Monday and Tuesday will be about 50 degrees, then 52 on Wednesday and a high of about 57 is expected for Thanksgiving Day, though the morning of Nov. 23 will be about 30 degrees, Outlaw said.

Before pulling the trigger, know what is behind your target. Fire crews may be working in the area.

Even if the fires are not actively burning, there are still hot spots and potential for reburn that could be dangerous to anyone within the interior of a burned area.

New firelines may be popular ways to walk into hunting spots, but also heavy equipment may be working along these firelines. Avoid approaching heavy equipment while it is working because the operator may not see you.

Trees have been weakened by the fire and could fall, so be cautious around snags and damaged trees.

Update on other WNC fires

Poplar Drive Fire: The fire burning in Henderson County has reached 100% containment and will continue to be monitored by N.C. Forest Service personnel. The fire footprint was 434 acres, and the cause was determined to be a debris burn.

Collett Ridge Fire: Burning in Cherokee and Clay counties in the Nantahala National Forest, the fire is 5,505 acres and 82% contained. The Collett Ridge Fire, determined to be started by lightning strike, is being managed under unified command by the U.S. Forest Service and N.C. Forest Service. Information on this fire can be found at facebook.com/nfsnc/.

Multiple fires continue to burn across Western North Carolina, including the Black Bear Fire off I-40 in Haywood County.

Fire totals: From Nov. 1-19, 828 fires have burned on state and private lands statewide, according to the N.C. Forest Service. Firefighters responded Nov. 18 to several small fires across the region, protecting more than 20 structures with an estimated total value over $100 million.

Burn ban notice: A burn ban was instated in 14 Western North Carolina counties Nov. 6 in response to severe drought conditions and multiple fires. On Nov. 8, the burn ban was expanded to an additional 16 counties amid persisting drought conditions and fires, with Gov. Roy Cooper declaring a state of emergency on Nov. 9.

The Blue Ridge Parkway has banned backcountry campfires, while the Great Smoky Mountains National Park has banned all campfires and charcoal use throughout the park.

SYDNEY (Reuters) – Firefighters were tackling bushfires that destroyed homes in the city of Perth amid a rare spring heatwave in Western Australia, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday.

Ten homes have already been destroyed, residents evacuated and several firefighters injured tackling the blaze in the city’s northern suburbs, Western Australia deputy premier Rita Saffioti told a news conference.

“Today will be a difficult day for everybody involved, but again I want to thank all of those who have done so much to keep damage to a minimum,” she said.

“It is important to note that their efforts have ensured that there has been no loss of human life.”

Authorities said they planned to open a COVID quarantine centre that had gone unused during the pandemic to house those made homeless by the fires.

The drought in Louisiana is so bad right now it has evoked country music comparisons, typically only used during exceptionally dire times.

“You heard that Hank Williams lyric, ‘The Mississippi River, she’s a-goin’ dry?’” asked Louisiana’s commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Mike Strain. “That’s how bad it is. This is one of the most severe droughts we’ve seen, certainly in my generation. It’s happening in lots of places nationwide.”

The drought, described as record-breaking and historical in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, peaked just as the federal government’s long-awaited Fifth National Climate Assessment was released Tuesday. It noted that while dangerous emissions in the U.S. have slowly decreased, they’re not happening fast enough to counter our warming planet.

The 144-page report offered a grave outlook and noted that the effects of climate change are becoming more tangible and easier to notice in communities across the country. Scientists are now more confident that the climate crisis is causing severe and frequent rainstorms, hurricanes, wildfires, drought and deadly heat.

America’s shifting drought

In recent years, drought has been a big issue in California, while the Southeast remains one of the wettest regions in the country. But in the second half of 2023, those roles have somewhat reversed. California, aided by numerous heavy rainstorms and snow in the early part of the year, has come out of its years-long drought. Most areas in Oregon and Washington are still in severe to extreme drought as of early November.

A vast majority of regions east of California, from Arizona to the Florida panhandle, are experiencing severe drought or worse, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a map produced by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in partnership with several federal agencies. Some areas along that route have gone months without more than an inch of rain.

The Mississippi River, which is drying up in parts throughout its snaking 2,340-mile course, is so dry that saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico is coming up the river, killing plants and animals, destroying crops and infrastructure and affecting water quality for the millions who rely on the river for drinking water.

The drought and the state of the Mississippi River are also causing widespread concern in the Midwest about water supply and barge deliveries. The region and the High Plains are also suffering severe to exceptional drought. The High Plains region consists of parts of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

Some Midwestern towns are drier than they were during the Dust Bowl, a period in the 1930s when millions of acres of farmland became useless and hundreds of thousands of people were displaced. It was brought on by severe drought and poor farming practices that left the land vulnerable to wind erosion. It’s considered one of the worst man-made ecological disasters in U.S. history.

The monitor also notes that severe drought conditions observed in Louisiana and Mississippi have continued eastward across Alabama, western Georgia, Florida’s panhandle, and Big Bend. This has caused particular issues for farmers and foresters trying to adapt to unpredictable weather from year to year.

“Many of our crops are down this year,” said Commissioner Strain. “Cotton is down 10%, while the acreage used is down about 40% as some were given up for planting corn. We’ve seen losses in rice and soybeans as well.”

Because of warmer spring weather, many of the farmers in Louisiana have fortunately been able to plant earlier in the season, including corn, according to Commissioner Strain. It means corn can reach the fertilization stage without encountering summer’s severe and damaging heat. He also noted that temperature shifts and water availability will eventually force farmers to plant different crops or plant their regular crops at other times of the year.

“We have to innovate if we’re going to survive,” he added. “We have to work with our agricultural centers and research institutions to develop more climate resilient crops that can produce more with less water and less inputs of all types and develop a good understanding of water availability.”

Farmers haven’t had it as bad in Alabama, depending on what crops they’re growing. The Alabama Farmers Federation (ALFA) said it had been a great year for corn in the state and may be a record yield.

”However, there are areas, particularly in south Alabama, where it’s been a very poor year for crops,” said Mary Wilson, ALFA’s communications outreach director. “Peanuts are the most impacted of the crops. The ground was so hard it was tough to get them out. Some cotton farmers experienced greatly reduced yields, particularly in the southern half of the state.”

Wilson said that cotton growers in the northern part of the state enjoyed an average or above-average crop, adding that Alabama sometimes has dry and wet years but was overall in good shape.

Because of drought, Alabama has declared a burn ban throughout the state, hoping to avoid devastating wildfires that have been seen in other states. Around 70% of the state is forested, giving it the fifth largest stock in the country behind Vermont, West Virginia, New Hampshire and Maine.

But when it comes to forests, drought can have lasting effects.

“The effects of drought can be seen now through the brown needles covering many of the pine trees,” said Thomas Reddick, executive director of the Alabama Forest Land Trust, a non-profit conservation organization that enhances, promotes, and preserves the productivity and sustainability of Alabama’s privately owned forests. “However, the real impact of drought won’t really be seen for a few years. Pine trees are resilient, but a drought like this puts a lot of stress on the tree which makes it susceptible to disease and pests that can kill the tree later.”

Reddick added that while Alabama has a robust timber industry, periods of drought may force landowners to bring their timber to market sooner than planned because pests may render the timber useless. The rush to harvest can also drive prices down for landowners. If the trees die, they significantly add to the risk of fire.

Why are we experiencing drought?

The question of why the Southeast is experiencing such exceptional levels of drought is not simple.

Jeff Graschel, a Louisiana-based hydrologist with the National Weather Service, attributes the drought to a high-pressure pattern that locked in over the region during summer. While that can happen, this current instance has resulted in extreme dryness.

“For Louisiana, Mississippi, it’s pretty historic,” he said. “We’re about 25 to 28 inches of rain behind normal for this time of year. It’s the highest threshold of drought we’ve seen in a long time.”

What’s unusual is that the region should have been much wetter because of the El Niño weather pattern, which historically dumps more rain on the Southeast thanks to the jet stream coming out of the Pacific Ocean.

El Niño is a tropical warm water zone extending through the Pacific toward South America. That warm water affects the atmosphere, altering wind patterns and the jet stream. It also leads to warmer air rising from the water, increasing the chances of clouds and rain. The jet stream then pushes those rain clouds across the country to various places, including the Southeast, while other regions may experience more drought.

The same weather pattern brought over 30 atmospheric rivers to California in 2023, including the first tropical storm to hit Los Angeles since 1939. That wasn’t expected, but it happened, potentially baffling people who are used to California being in perpetual drought.

The apparent contradictions in how our weather works drive home the complexities of explaining the difference between what we see in the news, what is predicated, and what we experience.

“It is certainly one of (the) biggest challenges, explaining the complexities of the weather and how it might not make sense or what people experience when they walk outside their front door,” added Graschel. “Unfortunately, it often takes people having to go through extreme events and stuff like that to realize it.”

Graschel said the Southeast should see more rainfall as the jet stream corrects itself as we move into December and January. In the long term, however, he said the Southeast should expect more extremes in the weather, but it’s hard to predict.

“There’s an indication that there would be more extreme events, meaning extreme floods and more droughts,” he said. “The climate models show that, but as far as being able to tell you what the weather might be in October of 2024, it would be very difficult to do that. But certainly, the climate models are showing that we should have more of these extremes coming in the future.”

The latest federal climate report

The government’s latest environmental report on climate change affirms what farmers, foresters, scientists, and vulnerable communities in the drought-hit Southeast are already experiencing and seeing; the region should expect more drought, flooding, and extreme weather in the coming decades and beyond.

“Some of the groups that will be particularly affected by all of the changes that we’re seeing as the climate continues to change—including extreme weather events, and flooding, droughts, wildfires, tornadoes, all those pieces—are communities that are at the front line of all of those various hazards as they increase in intensity and frequency,” said Lesley-Ann L. Dupigny-Giroux, professor at the University of Vermont and the Vermont state climatologist who wrote chapter five of the National Climate Assessment.

One of the latest advancements in climate science, which features significantly in the new report, is called “attribution science,” which allows scientists to conclusively show that climate change makes weather events, such as droughts, hurricanes and wildfires, far more extreme.

For example, greater levels of greenhouse gasses prevent heat from escaping the atmosphere. The ocean absorbs the heat instead, which can create more frequent, stronger and unpredictable hurricanes. Hurricane Otis, which hit the west coast of Mexico in late October, went from a tropical storm to a category five hurricane in under 12 hours, giving people less time to plan and evacuate.

Hurricane Idalia, which hit Florida’s Big Bend region in late August, also rapidly intensified, going from a tropical storm to a category three hurricane in about 24 hours. Both hurricanes broke records for the speed at which they intensified.

In addition, drought caused by warmer temperatures can dry out farmland and forests, meaning the likelihood and volatility of forest fires increases significantly. And once the ground becomes very dry, it loses the ability to absorb water, creating what is known as hydrophobic soil. So when rain does come, it can cause severe flash flooding.

”I’ve been fighting wildfires every day since August 21,” said Strain, the Louisiana commissioner. “It’s not a joke, and we all need to come together to do something about this crisis before it’s too late.”'",climate,drought
"'PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) -- The Maricopa County Department of Public Health says the county has matched the all-time yearly record for heat deaths.

Every year, the county has seen heat-associated deaths surge with the population increases, with each year’s total beating the previous record. This week’s numbers have now matched 2022′s numbers at 425 confirmed heat deaths. Another 199 are still under investigation, which means the county will break a record once again. The largest percentage of deaths continued to impact those aged 50-64.

“Even with extreme heat like we saw this summer, these deaths are preventable,” said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director for the department. “This tragic record reminds us that as a community, we have more work to do to prevent these deaths.” Sunenshine further explained, “Maricopa County residents and visitors should continue to practice heat safety and check on neighbors, even this late in the season, because heat illness and deaths can occur all the way into November due to rising temperatures.”

Earlier this week, Arizona’s Family reported that one of those who died from heat stroke was a volunteer for Feed Phoenix amidst a dangerous heatwave in September.

What heat prevention steps do I need to take in the Valley?

Limit outdoor activities to the coolest parts of the day

When spending extended amounts of time outdoors, go indoors to an air-conditioned location frequently

Don’t rely on fans as your primary source of cooling, especially when outdoor temperatures are 95 degrees or higher

Drink water throughout the day to prevent dehydration

Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunscreen, and lightweight clothes outdoors

Never leave kids, older adults, pets, and others who may rely on you inside of a parked car

Check on friends and neighbors, especially older adults, to ensure they have functioning air conditioning/cooling and enough water and supplies

"'Climate change presents a major public health concern in Australia, marked by unprecedented wildfires, heatwaves, floods, droughts, and the spread of climate-sensitive infectious diseases.

A paper published today (16 November) in The Lancet Regional Health: Western Pacific, details the rise in these events over the past two decades as well as the mitigation measures taken by national, state/territory and local governments – with a call for greater inclusion of Indigenous Australians in developing these mitigation measures.

The paper, led by Monash University's Professor Yuming Guo, argues that Australia's response to the climate crisis has been inadequate and subject to change by politics, public sentiment, and global developments.

""Our findings reveal significant impacts of climate-related environmental extremes on the health and well-being of Australians,"" Professor Guo said.

""While governments have implemented various adaptation strategies, these plans must be further developed to yield concrete actions. Moreover, Indigenous Australians should not be left out in these adaptation efforts.""

Australia has experienced some of the world's most extreme weather events in the last decade including the world's largest, most catastrophic epidemic thunderstorm asthma event in 2016, the extensive and devastating bushﬁres and extreme heat in the 'Black Summer' of 2019/2020, and the record rainfalls and widespread and repeated ﬂooding in 2021/2022.

According to Professor Guo, from the Monash University School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, ""these events overwhelmed emergency management and health systems, and led to considerable acute and chronic health impacts and deaths,"" he said.

""Australia has already warmed by 1.47 ◦C on average since 1910, accompanied by more frequent and intense extreme heat events. The country has also experienced one of the greatest increases in bushﬁre risk globally, prolonged droughts in the southern parts of the country, and an anticipated increase in extreme ﬂoods in the wetter northern parts. These risks are likely to escalate with devastating consequences for Australia's population, economy and environment.""

The paper warns that climate change may also worsen the health inequity that already exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, low and high socio-economic groups, and rural versus urban populations, with Australian agriculture and food security impacted by increased frequency of climate-related disasters.

Over 2 million Australian households (21 per cent) had experienced severe food insecurity in the previous 12 months, and disasters such as ﬂoods, bushﬁres and drought contributed to 19 per cent of the severe food insecurity.

The paper – commissioned by The Lancet – is highly critical of the way all Australian governments have dealt with the climate crisis.

""Australia's national responses to the climate crisis have been inadequate. Policy engagement by the former Federal Government was inadequate and limited, and climate change and health issues have been addressed in a siloed and disconnected way at the national level,"" the paper said.

""The Australian National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy released in October 2021 did not put health at the centre of the policies.""

The paper points to a small selection of exceptions: the Western Australian Government's Climate Health Inquiry in 2020, which was the ﬁrst statutory inquiry anywhere in the world focused on the health impacts of climate change; the Australian Medical Association (AMA) declaration of climate change as a health emergency in 2019, followed by other national health and medical associations, e.g., The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP); and a 2022 Australian Academy of Health and Medical Sciences (AAHMS) report that highlighted climate change as an urgent health priority.

Key climate change issues and health impacts:

Heatwaves have been identiﬁed as a major threat to human health. From 2000 to 2019, 2296 deaths were associated with heat-related temperatures per year in Australia. Several studies in Australia have shown that people who are more socioeconomically disadvantaged and remotely located are more vulnerable to the health impacts of heatwaves.

Over the period of 2000–2022, most Australian communities experienced at least 10 days of heatwave per year, and the number of heatwave days was often higher than 15 days per year in Queensland and Northern Territory communities.

In the 2018–2019 summer season, Australia encountered a prolonged and severe heatwave episode that persisted for more than two months, affecting multiple regions across the country and resulting in several unprecedented high-temperature records.

In January 2019, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology documented the country's highest-ever recorded average temperature, e.g., the temperature soared to a record breaking 46.6 ◦C in Adelaide. Moreover, the heatwave had a compounding effect on the intensity of bushﬁres that inﬂicted severe damage to several parts of the country, causing signiﬁcant loss of life and property.

The pronounced heatwaves have signiﬁcantly increased the mortality burden in Australia. Between July 2010 and January 2019, heatwaves in Queensland were associated with a 5 per cent increase in all-cause mortality compared to non-heatwave days.

Bushﬁres have a direct effect on human health from exposure to ﬂames and heat or involvement in bushﬁre events, such as burns, injuries, mental health and death, as well as a wide range of health risks from exposure to bushﬁre smoke, such as eye irritation and corneal abrasions, cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity, and adverse birth outcomes.

Among various air pollutants emitted by bushﬁres, particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) is the most important because it can travel hundreds of kilometres and affect a vastly larger population than the source ﬁres and has long term health implications such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancer.

The 2019-20 Black Summer bushfire smoke affected air quality both at the lower and higher reaches of the atmosphere. In eastern Australia, population exposure to bushﬁre PM2.5 during the 'Black Summer' was estimated to be responsible for 417 excess deaths, 1124 cardiovascular and 2027 respiratory hospital admissions, and 1305 asthma-related emergency department presentations. The total smoke-related physical health costs during the 2019–2020 bushﬁre period have been estimated at AUD $1.95 billion.

Floods are an increasing risk as heavy rainfall events become more common. Queensland is the state most impacted by ﬂoods, with New South Wales (NSW) being the second most impacted. In addition to infrastructure and property damage, floods can have direct and indirect effects on human health through the contamination of water and food supply systems, as well as increasing the risk of infectious diseases and impact on mental health.

Drought is associated with increased risk of bushﬁres, dust storms and heatwaves, which can induce increased mortality and cardiorespiratory problems. Limited access to clean water can lead to increased risks of infectious illnesses and can cause food insecurity. Drought may also induce mental health problems.

"'Serena Williams is doing her part to help new parents in need. On Wednesday, the tennis superstar — who welcomed her second daughter, Adira River Ohanian, in August — revealed that she donated her leftover breast milk to people who are unable to breastfeed their babies.

In a video posted to Instagram, Williams opened a freezer full of packets of her extra breast milk from a recent trip from New York. ""After going through a screening I was able to donate it instead of taking the milk home. I know so many amazing women that adopt or are unable to make milk. It felt amazing,"" she wrote in the caption, adding: ""BTW Someone out there is getting some super soldier milk. 🤭.""

During the short clip, Serena could be heard saying that she was ""really excited"" to donate ""to people who really need it,"" before clarifying that no one will know it's her breast milk when they receive it. She explained, ""It’ll be anonymous, but super excited to just help in some way.”

Fans praised Serena for her contribution in the comments section of her post. ""My baby is adopted and ended up having severe dairy allergies, so we relied on donor milk. It was such a gift to us and I’m always so grateful when I think about it,"" one user shared, while another wrote, ""I was a preemie who relied on donated breast milk and I’m now a healthy 30 year old. Really amazing thing to do!""



A third added, ""Women supporting women in the most basic and loving way.""



Serena's donation comes a few weeks after she discovered another use for her extra milk. On TikTok, the Grand Slam champion told fans that she had a sunburn underneath her eye and was going to try to treat it with breast milk. ""I was in the sun ... long story. Anyways, I'm trying some breast milk,"" she said in the video. ""It works for my kid — they say put breast milk on everything and I have a lot extra, so I'm gonna try it for a week or so under my eye and see how it goes.""

When a new wildfire starts in the forest, wildland fire dispatchers are the people in charge of getting resources where they need to go. Their early decisions can help to keep a small fire from getting huge. But a 2022 survey of wildland fire dispatchers in Oregon and Washington by the U.S. Forest Service found that “dispatch is experiencing problems that compromise their own health and safety” as well as “the health and safety of other firefighters,” according to a new article in High Country News. Kylie Mohr, a correspondent for High Country News who wrote that story, joins us to talk about it.

Note: The following transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer.

Dave Miller: This is Think Out Loud on OPB. I’m Dave Miller. When a wildfire starts, wildland fire dispatchers are the people in charge of getting resources where they need to go. Their decisions can help to keep a small fire from getting out of control. But a recent survey by the forest service found that wildfire dispatchers in Oregon and Washington are dealing with issues that are a threat to their own health and safety as well as the health and safety of other firefighters. Kylie Mohr wrote about this for High Country News and she joins us now to talk about it. Welcome to the show.

Kylie Mohr: Thanks so much for having me.

Miller: Can you give us a sense for what the job actually entails, what wildland fire dispatchers do?

Mohr: Absolutely. So like you said, dispatchers are often some of the first people who are in charge of calling in resources when a fire is reported. So when a new fire needs air tankers or helicopters dropping retardant or water, dispatchers are the ones coordinating what’s flying where, so the aircraft don’t collide. If firefighters get hurt during a fire, dispatchers are the ones who are sending medical help to oftentimes really remote areas. And then once the fire is underway, dispatchers relay information to and from the fire line like wind, humidity, temperature forecasts. So they do a lot, but they’re a really crucial link kind of in the communication and operations chain.

Miller: How much of the decision making falls on their shoulders? I mean, is it up to them to decide whether or not to put out a specific fire, or is that a higher up manager?

Mohr: That’s not really the dispatcher’s decision. Decisions about how or if to fight a fire are made by other people on the ground or people higher up the leadership chain of command. But then those people are the ones calling the dispatchers with what they want and what they need and the dispatchers are then in charge of figuring out how to execute those requests and get resources, people, where they need to be as quickly as possible.

Miller: Can you give us a sense for what dispatchers might be exposed to, what they might hear, the conversations they might have over the course of a shift?

Mohr: Dispatchers are in a really high contact position because they’re communicating with people, sometimes on multiple fires at once. So kind of on the severe end of things, they might overhear chatter or be involved in operations that include finding injured or killed civilians in the middle of a fire. They might be involved when a firefighter is critically injured by a snag, or some other accident on the fire line. The fire community is really pretty tight knit and small, and so sometimes they might overhear conversations about something bad happening to someone that they know. Worst case scenario, one of the dispatchers I spoke with for the story actually ended up overhearing two different firefighter fatalities playing out during her shift. So there can definitely be some pretty traumatizing things that dispatchers are exposed to.

Miller: Why did the U.S. Forest Service conduct a survey of dispatchers in Oregon and Washington last fall?

Mohr: A risk manager for the region, his name is Matt Holmstrom, and he’s a Forest Service employee who led this whole effort. And he told me it’s been a really long time since dispatchers have been kind of examined or checked in on, in this far reaching way, and that it was really overdue. He also told me that the agency really needs to understand its problems in order to find solutions. So that was his approach to the survey.

Miller: What were you able to learn about the scope of the survey?

Mohr: So it included detailed interviews with about 104 of the 189 dispatchers that work in the 14 largest dispatch centers in Region 6, which is agency lingo for Oregon and Washington. And dispatching, like firefighting, tends to be pretty interagency in nature, because fires cross jurisdictions quickly. So oftentimes there’s Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, State Agency, etcetera dispatchers, all working in the same center. So the survey also included people employed by those other entities, not just Forest Service.

Miller: You filed a FOIA request, a Freedom of Information Act request, to get access to a presentation of the survey results as well as transcripts from some of those interviews with over 100 dispatchers. But that request was denied. What did you hear?

Mohr: Well, the Forest Service said releasing those materials would compromise its decision making ability and prematurely announce proposed policies. We appealed that denial and we’re still waiting to see if that gains any traction. They did release some emails as part of the FOIA that were mostly just about the planning process, but the communication did have some kind of illustrative gems in it, including leadership acknowledging that, quote, “Our margins for error are so slim now due to vacancies and increases in workload.”

Miller: What else were you able to learn about the results of the survey?

Mohr: Absolutely. So, I was lucky enough to have some Powerpoint presentation slides of the survey leaked to me and that really helped kind of flesh out the story. That’s how I knew that recruitment, retention and vacancies were identified as major issues, among a bunch of other things that I think we’re going to talk about in this interview. The survey also identified, the interviews identified some kind of unnerving anecdotes. For example, one dispatcher had to have emergency medical surgery because they were so short staffed the person couldn’t take bathroom breaks, but they had known gallbladder issues. And another, an entire dispatch center was on the verge of quitting during fire season last year and even though that didn’t end up happening, there was a lot of turnover and now the center is really short staffed with almost no backup in key positions. So yeah, the slides were very helpful in flushing it all out.

Miller: As I mentioned in my intro, the survey found that dispatchers were experiencing problems. It compromised their own health and safety as well as the health and safety of firefighters on the line. Let’s take these one by one, starting with that second one. How might problems that a dispatcher is experiencing affect the health and safety of firefighters?

Mohr: So the survey identified that problem without giving super specific examples. But the thought is that if dispatch centers aren’t fully staffed or if the dispatchers are exhausted or dealing with mental stress and trauma that there’s more room for mistakes, basically. So maybe resources don’t get called in fast enough. So firefighters end up in harm’s way, in the path of a fire, or maybe communications break down. So firefighters don’t know about something that they should, that would benefit their safety, that kind of thing.

Miller: I mean, I guess it’s analogous to say air traffic controllers, if the people in the towers are super stressed out, if it’s understaffed, if they can’t do their jobs well enough, there could be disasters, as we’ve been talking about, hearing about recently in other places. So, what about the health and safety of dispatchers themselves? What have you heard?

Mohr: Yeah. So some additional research on dispatchers nationwide, I think really helps us answer this question. Some researchers at the Missouri University of Science and Technologies Ozark Research Station, which is such a mouthful, they did a survey of over 500 dispatchers nationwide and it found that 10% were considered at high risk for suicide compared to 0.3% of the general population. So that’s a really striking and sad comparison. And the survey work that they did also found that dispatchers have really high rates of signs of depression and signs of PTSD compared to the general population. So, I think it’s safe to say that they’re experiencing some really challenging mental health issues.

Miller: Are they getting support for the work-based mental health challenges that they’re experiencing?

Mohr: That really varies, but overall my reporting found that dispatchers are often forgotten when it comes to mental health support. The dispatcher I mentioned earlier who overheard multiple fatalities said she felt overlooked and wasn’t offered the kind of trauma-informed resources that are out there. And in some instances, this can lead to dispatchers trying to numb their pain with alcohol and drugs, which is a really slippery slope that both of these surveys identified. The Forest Service survey team said that what’s really needed is the creation of stress first aid materials that are specifically tailored for dispatchers. And also that the Forest Service really needs to follow its existing stress management protocol. So the protocols might exist, but if they’re not being offered to dispatchers, then they’re not doing their job.

Miller: What did you hear about workloads and work life balance? You mentioned earlier that the agency did mention recruitment and retention and vacancies as issues. So clearly, they’re aware of what not having enough people doing these jobs means. But for the people who are there, how many hours do they have to work?

Mohr: It’s really tough. Over half of survey respondents said that they had little to no work/life balance. Many of them feel forced to take on overtime work. They can’t get time off, they don’t receive adequate breaks, shifts can be up to 16 hours long or more during fire season. One dispatcher even told me that his personal record is over 24 hours. So that’s a full day and night of working in this high stress position. And that creates a really vicious cycle where the more experienced dispatchers are heavily relied upon, they’re overworked, then they quit and then the people who are left have even more on their plate.

So it just kind of keeps cycling through and that lack of work/life balance can be really harmful. The dispatcher’s ability to show up for their friends, their relationships, their families, to be present in their life outside of work and fulfill other commitments or obligations that they might have.

Miller: How does pay factor into this?

Mohr: Pay is definitely an issue. Dispatchers say that better pay would really help recruit and retain more people which theoretically should kind of help everything we’ve been talking about. An average Forest Service dispatcher’s base pay is roughly $15 to $20 an hour, and as we know, that’s barely a livable wage in Oregon and elsewhere in the West. Pay for firefighters in general is sort of up in the air right now, with these temporary pay raises that some dispatchers also received from the Infrastructure Bill, they’re set to run out. And there’s work going on in Congress right now to try to figure out a long term solution for that. But there’s also uncertainty around the future of what dispatcher retirement benefits will look like in the long term. And all of that really adds up to a pretty unstable financial picture for dispatchers and another reason that they say they might not stick around.

Miller: You noted that the reason the agency - the U.S. Forest Service - gave you for not releasing the details of the survey is that it could get in the way of the policy changes that they could institute as a result of this survey. Do you have any sense for how they might change their policies as a result of what they’ve learned?

Mohr: I wish I had a better answer to that question. Systemic changes at the federal level, as a result of this survey, are pretty murky right now. When I asked specifically the question that you just asked me, what policies or changes might come about as a result of the survey, a Forest Service spokesperson was fairly cagey and kind of told me just to stay tuned. There are some small changes underway, that includes things like more training for leadership and dispatch centers on how to handle stressful situations and some sharing of resources between centers to help bring short term people up to speed quicker. But none of that is really the systemic, broad policy change that the survey really seems to point towards needing.

Miller: Kylie, thanks very much.

Mohr: Thank you.

Miller: Kylie Mohr is a Montana based correspondent for High Country News. She joined us to talk about the challenges that Northwest wildfire dispatchers are facing right now.

"'Texas Rangers' Adolis Garcia, right, yells at Houston Astros catcher Martin Maldonado after being hit by a pitch during the eighth inning in Game 5 of the baseball American League Championship Series Friday, Oct. 20, 2023, in Arlington, Texas. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez)

ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Dusty Baker already was screaming at the umpires when the Houston Astros manager grabbed his hat, held it briefly and then just threw it.

The latest dustup between the Astros and Texas Rangers had the 74-year-old saying he was madder than he had been in a long time, an emotion cooled somewhat by José Altuve's go-ahead home run in the ninth inning of a 5-4 win Friday that put the defending champion Astros up 3-2 in the AL Championship Series.

Houston's Bryan Abreu and Baker were ejected from Game 5 after the reliever hit the Rangers' Adolis García with a pitch in the eighth, triggering benches to clear two innings following the slugger's go-ahead home run.

García also was ejected by the umpires during a confrontation that caused a nearly 12-minute delay. Crew chief James Hoye said Abreu was tossed for throwing with intent and García for being the aggressor in a confrontation with catcher Martín Maldonado.

“How do you prove intent?” Baker asked. “That's what I don't understand. I haven’t been that mad in a long time. And I don’t usually get mad about nothing. So I’m just glad that we won the game and it turned out right for us.”

Houston trailed 4-2 before Altuve's dramatic three-run homer in the ninth off José Leclerc.

Following Evan Carter's leadoff walk in the eighth, García was hit on his upper left arm by a 98.9 mph first-pitch fastball and immediately turned and got into Maldonado's face. García dropped his bat and waved his right index finger in Maldonado's face while the slugger was held back by plate umpire Marvin Hudson. García managed to extend his left arm over the umpire and shove Maldonado's right shoulder

Both benches and bullpens cleared, with players from both sides surrounding each other at home plate. García was restrained by Houston's Yordan Alvarez, a fellow Cuban, and Rangers teammates.

“It was just the heat of the moment,” García said through a translator when asked why he turned toward Maldonado instead of Abreu. “I just reacted to being hit by the pitch. I just reacted towards him as soon as I felt the hit. It was just a thing that happened in that instant.”

The umpires conferenced and ejected Abreu and García. Baker walked in front of the Astros dugout, arms spread wide, and got into an animated conversation with three of the umpires. Baker threw his cap, then was ejected, too. He continued to argue from the dugout with Hudson for six minutes before heading to the clubhouse.

The Rangers led 4-2 after García's three-run homer in the sixth. He took 16 steps up the line as he watched the ball and pounded his chest, and was more than halfway to first when he empathically spiked his bat and started jogging.

The 30.5-second home run trot was the fourth-longest of García's big league career, according to MLB Statcast.

“He's a power hitter,” Maldonado said. “He can do whatever he wants.”

On July 26 in Houston, Alvarez got hit by a pitch right after Alex Bregman homered in the first inning of that series finale, and Texas' Marcus Semien took a retaliatory plunk in the third.

Semien hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the fourth, and exchanged words with Maldonado. An inning later, Semien scored on a grand slam by García, who was face to face with the catcher when the benches cleared, though no punches were thrown.

Asked if the July incident could have played a part in García's reaction, Maldonado said, “Could be. If you still had that in mind this late in the year. That's up to him. We turned the page.”

The Astros contended they were focused on erasing a two-run deficit in the ninth and wouldn't have wanted to put extra runners on base.

Texas had two runners on with no outs, then runners at the corners with one out, but didn't score after Josh Jung and Nathaniel Lowe struck out.

“I think given the situation I think it’s pretty clear that there’s no intent there,” Houston starter Justin Verlander said. “I don’t think anybody is mad about him pimping a homer. It was the biggest homer in his career, quite honestly. Obviously he thought something might happen, though, because it was a pretty quick reaction.”

If the Astros were mad at García's celebration, the slugger said they shouldn't have been.

“I think we’re in the postseason. It’s the moment,” said García, who has four homers this postseason. “You hit a ball like that, you’re going to celebrate. It’s where we’re at right now. If they’re trying to react to that, I don’t think that’s the correct way.”

"'Pennsylvania has established a task force to recommend policies to make flood insurance more affordable.

The Flood Insurance Premium Assistance Task Force will examine potential programs that provide premium discounts, incentives for local governments to support flood mitigation efforts, necessary changes to state statute or policy regarding the administration of flood insurance, and how to increase the number of people who purchase flood insurance, either through the national flood insurance program or the private flood insurance marketplace.

Insurance Commissioner Mike Humphreys will chair the task force, which was established when Gov. Josh Shapiro signed HB 735 into law. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Perry Warren, passed the House and the Senate with bipartisan support after flooding impacted several Pennsylvania communities, including Bucks County, over the summer.

Shapiro said the task force will bring together leaders from his Administration and the Legislature to review the needs of communities that are at an increased risk of flooding and recommend the best courses of action to help increase the number of Pennsylvanians protected by flood insurance.

In recent years, the Federal Emergency Management Agency revised its flood maps, which require that flood insurance be obtained for more properties. As a result, flood insurance premiums are rising.

“After flooding disasters, PID hears devastating stories from residents who thought they were covered for flood through their homeowners’ insurance policy but were not. FEMA’s revised flood maps now require more Pennsylvania properties to hold flood insurance and many owners are struggling to meet that requirement,” said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys. “PID strongly encourages insurance agents to highlight the availability of flood coverage when meeting with clients to discuss new or renewal coverage – and we urge homeowners and renters to ask their insurance agents and insurance companies about flood coverage.”

Flood insurance has traditionally only been available to homeowners or renters through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), but today there are more options for consumers to consider. Flood insurance is available through private insurers, including surplus lines insurers, and can be purchased through licensed property/casualty insurance agents in Pennsylvania to cover almost any building and its contents, including rental property and condominiums. Tenants can buy protection for their belongings as well.

"'A manhunt is under way to catch the “armed and dangerous” suspect wanted in connection to the murder of a Maryland judge.

Judge Andrew Wilkinson was found dead from gunshot wounds in the driveway of his home in Hagerstown, Maryland, on Thursday evening.

Law enforcement including US Marshals are now searching for Pedro Argote, 49, who is accused of targeting the judge in anger over a court ruling.

Hours before the shooting, the judge granted custody of Mr Argote’s four children to his ex-wife, Eugeina Argote, in a divorce hearing. Court records show he has a history of verbal domestic assaults against his wife and family.

Over the weekend, police confirmed that Mr Argote’s vehicle had been found in a wooded area in Williamsport – around eight miles from the crime scene.

Investigators have now warned he could be headed for New York, Florida, Indiana or North Carolina as he has ties to the various locations.

The US Marshals Service is now offering a reward of $10,000 for any information that could lead to his arrest.

What we know about Pedro Argote’s alleged past

Judge Wilkinson had awarded custody of the Argotes’ four children to Eugenia Argote hours before he was shot and killed.

The suspect had a history of controlling and cruel behaviour towards his ex-wife, according to court documents.

This behaviour reportedly included keeping hold of her car keys at all times so he knew when she was leaving home, stealing money from her, harassing her via text messages, using security cameras to monitor her, and even an accusation that he had been violent with their child.

The couple also had a long history of domestic incidents and in 2012, his ex-wife claimed, adding that she had tried to get help from a domestic violence advocacy center.

Judge Wilkinson also granted a temporary order in June 2022 which required Mr Argote to leave the couple’s shared residence and surrender his firearms. However the order was later dismissed at Ms Argote’s request, though it is unclear why.

"'The Las Vegas Aces parlayed their dominating regular season by winning their second consecutive WNBA title, holding off the New York Liberty 70-69 Wednesday.

The Aces became the first back-to-back WNBA champs in 21 years. Las Vegas won the best-of-five-game series 3-1.

The Aces, who are led on the court by A'ja Wilson and on the bench by coach Becky Hammon, managed to win the title without the presence of Candace Parker late in the regular season and throughout the playoffs.

Fans appeared to be entertained by this year's matchup featuring the top two teams from the regular season. The WNBA reported that television ratings through the first three games were up 13% compared to the 2022 WNBA Finals. The first three games of the Finals were also the most-watched WNBA Finals since 2003.

Fans who tuned in to Game 4 were treated to yet another stellar performance by Wilson, who had 24 points and 16 rebounds.

Her performance was needed as the Aces were down by as many as 12 points in the third quarter. She helped the Aces build a 70-64 lead in the final minutes of the game, but a Courtney Vandersloot 3-pointer and steal and a Sabrina Ionescu jumper gave the Liberty an opportunity to win and force a pivotal Game 5. Vandersloot had an attempt at the buzzer but missed.

After winning 34 out of 40 games in the regular season, the Aces won all but one of their nine playoff contests.

It may have just been too soon to bring Max Scherzer back into the postseason fray.

In his start since Sept. 12, Scherzer got shelled in Game 3 of the ALCS against the Houston Astros at Globe Life Field en route to an 8-5 loss, giving the reigning champions some hope as they got their first win of the series.

Scherzer had been out for more than a month with a strained muscle in his right shoulder but was named the starter for Game 3 earlier in the series. Unfortunately for the Rangers, it was a rough outing for the veteran.

The three-time Cy Young award winner got hit early and often, giving up five runs in just four innings of work, including a massive solo homer to José Altuve in the third inning.

The Astros were confident in their ability to face Scherzer—who was at one time one of the most feared pitchers in all of MLB—and showed why. They handled everything the future Hall of Famer had to throw at them.

Scherzer struggled against the Astros in the regular season as well. In his penultimate start of the regular season, he gave up seven runs—three homers—in just three innings against Houston back on Sept. 6.

"'WEST ASHLEY — One man was killed and another injured in a shooting the afternoon of Dec. 21 at a sprawling playground and sports hub in a residential neighborhood, according to local police.

Officers with the Charleston Police Department were dispatched before 1:30 p.m. to the Forest Park Playground at 780 Playground Road in response to a report of gunfire, according to Sgt. Anthony Gibson. Officers located a man lying between the playground's tennis courts and its parking lot suffering from a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers located another man nearby who had been shot but sustained injuries that were not life threatening, Gibson said. He was treated at the scene.

Other officers canvassed the area for evidence but have not yet identified any suspects. Police believe the shooting was an isolated incident and there is no known threat to the public.

Yellow crime scene tape cordoned off the entrance to the playground around 2 p.m. Two ambulances and a dozen police officers stood in the parking lot on North Sherwood Drive. Near the vacant tennis courts, a white body bag lay underneath a beige tent and a grand oak tree.

The Charleston County Coroner's Office has not yet released the name of the deceased. He is the eighth person killed by gun violence in Charleston this calendar year, according to data maintained by The Post and Courier.

Gibson said he was unsure if other people were frequenting the park when gunshots rang out. It was a cool but sunny winter day, with temperatures nearing 60 degrees just a few days before Christmas.

The public playground is home to two tennis courts, two full-sized basketball courts and a baseball field. It also features the Joe Griffith Miracle Field, part of The Charleston Miracle League, an indoor playground building and an aquatic center. Hoopsters regularly assemble weekly for pickup games and city football teams practice in open fields.

1.

During the atrocious October of this year, attention to the acutely charged language taking precedence in English-language media revealed a particularly heavy reliance on one term: “paralysis.” For a largely metaphorical term, this reliance was not only recurrent but also distinct for how it spanned two radically different contexts. On one hand, it was deployed repetitively to frame the stasis and chaos of the US House of Representatives, as far-right Republicans “threw the chamber into a state of paralysis.” The “House remains paralyzed with no end in sight” said one report, and another, in an odd doubling, stated that a “paralyzed federal government paralyzes the nation.” On the other, the term appeared again and again with regards to the war on Gaza. Former prime minister Ehud Barak insisted Israel was “determined to make sure that Hamas is paralyzed,” while Dr. Mustafa Barghouti warned urgently that Gaza was “heading towards a complete paralysis of the medical system.” News outlets and sources on the ground alike spoke of a “total paralysis of economic activity,” of the ambulance response “paralyzed” by communications blackout, and of how, in the words of Riyad Mansour, the response of the UN Security Council was “paralysed, not acting.” Yet the repetition of the term is by no means new or the sign of a search for dramatic language amidst the unspeakable. It reaches back long before, as part of the explicit long-term strategy of Israel and how it has “virtually paralyzed the Palestinian population without ‘defeating’ it,” aiming to make “the whole population captive to fear and paralysis.” And it extends far beyond a mere figurative use, to the way that the military tactics themselves described under the sign of this term harm those with physical paralysis, especially those whose assistive devices were destroyed in the bombing, and who now confront an even greater difficulty in “relocating” themselves than what was already faced by all the other Palestinians guided by Israel to the supposed safe zones that were subsequently bombed.

In this context, the use of the word “paralysis,” and the circuits formed between its metaphorical and bluntly corporeal meanings, is markedly dense and bleak. Yet its appearance here is hardly exceptional, because both as a specific term and as a trope, paralysis has become so central to contemporary thought about politics, war, labor, subjectivity, and infrastructure that it vanishes into ubiquity, only becoming discernible when we start to actively track its repetitions. Similar to “sabotage,” to which it has been closely bound for the past 130 years, the idea of paralysis, as well as the word itself, gets employed both in highly specific contexts, such as military operations and shipping strikes, and in wholly generic ones, from casual conversation to the dire hinterland between pop psychology and management-consultancy speak. But unlike sabotage, which was relatively rare slang prior to being explicitly posed as a political tactic in the 1890s by French anarcho-syndicalists (and then proceeding to become a word deployed everywhere from guerrilla warfare handbooks to sleep apnea clickbait), a full genealogy of paralysis would need to trace its links across more enormous historical and geographic terrain. Because even if we are to restrict the term to just its English variant (and to other languages that inherit the same Greek root “παράλυσις,” itself meaning “palsy” or simply “paralysis”), the term is ancient, in continued use, and marked again and again by a conduit between actual experiences of bodily paralysis, the particular social visibility and denigration of those who are paralyzed, and the word’s use as a metaphor for any inability to act despite the intention to do so.

University of Tokyo protests, 1969. Photo: Hitomi Watanabe.

This essay is not any attempt at such a total genealogy. Rather, as part of my wider research into histories of forms of agency and insurgence that hover at the edge of what is understood as political, I read across and between the prevalent contemporary uses of paralysis to try and defamiliarize the idea and make its peculiar contours palpable again. In doing so, what becomes apparent is that despite those persistent and almost transhistorical uses, the idea and word now indexes a historically quite specific and comparatively recent set of anxieties and possibilities. These are ones intimately bound to the production and reproduction of a world that is itself bound together in increasingly complex networks of capital, territory, technology, and organic life. And paralysis is right at the heart of them. Because insofar as those social and material circuits are marked not only by attempts to decrease inefficiency and friction within processes of exchange but also by the “tight coupling” of infrastructural and circulatory systems of labor, machinery, resources, fuel, and computation, paralysis becomes the prospect to be warded off at all costs, insofar as it means lag time, stoppages, bottlenecks, and missed connections.

To be sure, this is not a story of total rationalization, of a general tendency towards a lightly dystopian but smoothly functioning set of flows in which digital logistics and streamlining reign supreme. There is no contradiction between complex computation and the uneven and profoundly violent geographies of capital whose material processes are often literally paralyzing to the bodies enmeshed in them, from zones of war to labor that is repetitive, debilitating, and toxic. Yet insofar as these geographies and those who profit from them are dependent on the technical and social circuits detailed above, they are also continually threatened by those same circuits, because they incorporate and require the very mechanisms that enable their disabling. In other words, the histories at work here—of blackouts, care strikes, downed servers, blocked shipping corridors, dynamited railways—are neither those of political pressure nor of simple destruction. They are histories of interstices, and of what can be activated, sabotaged, turned against itself and interrupted so as to produce an interval that cannot be endured, whether by a corporation whose fruit sits rotting at a port or by a city under siege by “nonlethal” strategic bombing that destroys access to fresh water.

The name for this interval is paralysis itself.

2.

But how exactly does this term and trope get used, beyond reference to actual bodily paralysis? In its most basic sense, and the one common among these varied instances, it names a condition of inaction that persists against any intention to act or react. More specifically—and counter to the way that corporeal paralysis is often experienced and culturally envisioned as permanent, marking a catastrophic shift in how a life will be lived from that point on—paralysis as a figure of political and social thought instead frames a distinct kind of reversible breakdown, one that is not understood as violence, or even damage, per se. Rather, it implies a temporary interruption of the expected connections between thought and action. That interruption can lead to disastrous consequences, because of an inability to respond, flee, reply, decide, or fight back, but it does not signal a disaster or decisive debilitating event in and of itself. Instead, its specificity lies in how it renders suddenly irrelevant the technical ability to do something, or the possession of adequate strength or skill or tools or supplies. In this way, the idea of paralysis in its wider drift of meaning crucially comes to mark not a negation of ability or capacity in general but a breakdown of the links that bind sender to receiver, whether they be neurological or social, electronic or inscribed by the repeated transit of a shipping container back and forth across the sea. And although paralysis gets used as an idea across a seemingly heterogeneous range of instances, these links are not of any connection whatsoever. As suggested before, they are particularly those that alone enable a hypothetically seamless passage from decision to transmission to result—and often from extraction to production to distribution to consumption—and that remain taken for granted until becoming suddenly evident in the interval of paralysis, when the communication that passes through them gets scrambled, halted, or lost somewhere in that interstitial space.

These aspects are all active in the most quotidian use of the idea, that of being paralyzed with fear or indecision. Both variants are familiar in daily conversation and in how we try to narrate the loss of our ability to respond when we need to most, or the way we spin in circles around what should be a simple choice. They also become stock phrases and notions of particular interest to the grifters of self-help and pop psychology who seek to profit off such experiences—grifters such as Lisa Jimenez. A Christian management consultant, Jimenez manages to join together the two versions of fear and indecision:

One of the biggest barriers that all salespeople have to overcome is fear. Fear of failure. Fear of rejection. Fear of change. Fear of success. Fear of making decisions. Fear of responsibility. Fear of commitment. It is fear (and all of its cousins, such as worry, anxiety, depression, and self-doubt) that will turn your dream of success into a chilling nightmare that haunts you into paralysis.

For the most part, paralysis by fear and paralysis by decision-making aren’t so interwoven, or at least not like in this baleful slab of aspiring business guru ideology. To speak of the former, which is often interchangeable with the language of being “frozen” or “petrified,” describes a sudden confrontation with something that is terrifying or traumatic, and that demands the very urgency of response that paralysis paradoxically prohibits. To be clear, this is hardly just a figure of speech. It describes a real physiological reaction known in humans and nonhuman animals alike as “tonic immobility.” The social stakes are enormous, given that it is this reaction that is not only common among those subjected to sexual assault or abuse, but that is also continuously cited as one of the reasons to deny the validity of their claims, under the pretext of someone having not “fought back.” This sense of freezing up when faced with threat is active in other forms of figuring paralysis as well. It appears often in the context of hypnosis or a sense of fascination (Siegfried Bernfeld: “Fascination … is a state of extremely heightened attention together with complete motor inhibition; if that state was continued longer it would be possible to speak of paralysis”). And in the incisive work of Spyros Papapetros, to be paralyzed is not the opposite of being animated but the consequence of excess animation, of an excitation that has nowhere to go and, so overwhelmed, ends in paralysis: “Every instance of animation is complemented by an equivalent occurrence of paralysis. As in the myth of Daphne … excitation rises to such levels that the subject instantly freezes and is unable to react.”

Conversely, with decision-making, it is the lack of urgency that ends up generating urgency, as too much time, too much choice, and too many variables to consider end up deferring any decision until the situation indeed becomes pressing. However, what joins these two versions is that whether there is excess of threat/stimulation or excess of options, the resultant paralyses are grasped as internal, thick with the sense of being betrayed by your own body and mind, and resulting in a stasis that evinces not only that something has gone extremely wrong with mechanisms of thought and response but also that this stasis was produced by their regular function, rather than its absence. A hardwired system of almost instinctual response overloads an organism when it needs it the most. A complex capacity to reflect and consider possible courses of action reveals so many paths that it can’t pick a single one. In those moments, we feel ourselves riven, as the illusion of being a self-controlling subject of free will falls apart to show us instead as a system in disarray, one unable to restore the grace and autonomy of instantaneous reaction that conceptions of the able-bodied and able-minded take as both given and natural.

Even if this trope of individual paralysis has now entered the dual terrain of almost unspeakable shock and excessively speakable TED talks, the greatest influence on it comes from a far more specific and precise field of inquiry into speech, that of psychoanalysis. This is also the source of the distinct notion of torqued subjectivity undergirding contemporary paralysis: a subject subjected to the revenge effects of their own modes of processing and responding. However, we can’t reduce this to a simple influence of psychoanalysis on ideas of paralysis. The influence flows the other way as well, because the question of paralysis forms one of the key points of departure in the early years of Sigmund Freud’s thinking and practice, as well as in the wider orbits of analysis that take shape around him. Within that span of research, paralysis functions specifically as the most explicit instance of a physically manifesting symptom whose causes cannot be located in any specific bodily injury or defect. It is there in Freud’s reckoning with Charcot’s category of “hysterical paralysis,” his subsequent “Some Points for a Comparative Study of Organic and Hysterical Motor Paralyses” (1888), the case study of Anna O., and outwards from there. It is also present beyond these most explicit appearances, because the dynamic I identified at the core of paralysis animates one of the central impulses of psychoanalysis: to seek to understand the exchanges and feedback between language and body, information and materiality, and conscious intention and resultant action, yet crucially to do so through attention to where and when those relations don’t work, through a symptomatology of the disrupted, misplaced, projected, and repressed.

Psychoanalytic concerns and concepts are also evident in another frequent use of paralysis, one that transposes the individual logic of fear/indecision onto a mass level in order to diagnose the problem of negated collective experience and thwarted political possibility. This version is particularly common in radical and Marxist theorists, organizers, and artists across a broad geographical range, including throughout anti-colonial political and artistic histories. In Latin American writings on cinema, for instance, Fernando Berri insists in 1962 that “Latin American filmmakers must transform all such technical limitations into new expressive possibilities, if we are not to remain paralyzed by them,” while Julio Garcia Espinosa suggests that in the horizon of popular liberation, “nobody and nothing will any longer be able to again paralyze the creative spirit of the people.” This sense of colonialism’s blockage and neutralization of popular energies is also active in Amilcar Cabral, in a manner analogous to the “thingification” of Aimé Cesaire: for Cabral, the “main effect produced by the impact of imperialism on the historical process of the dominated people is paralysis, stagnation (even in some cases, regression) in that process.”

One can find mass paralysis playing an especially important role across the Frankfurt School and associated thinkers. It is explicitly present in the work of Walter Benjamin (as the consequence of a “defensive mimetic adaptation that protects at the price of paralyzing”) and of Herbert Marcuse (a “paralysis of criticism”). For Theodor Adorno, paralysis appears both within its hypnotic and spell-casting form—such as his account of how the “element of madness … paralyzes and attacks followers of mass movements of all kinds” —and in his reformulation, in Minima Moralia, of the trope of the shocks of modernity and its penetration of psychic defense: “Everywhere, with each explosion, it has breached the barrier against stimuli beneath which experience, the lag between healing oblivion and healing recollection, forms. Life has changed into a timeless succession of shocks, interspaced with empty, paralyzed intervals.”

I will note here a crucial aspect of this usage, where the paralysis appears not as a paralyzed thing or being, but rather as taking shape in the intermediary intervals of experience and communication, as I’ve already stressed. But in that orbit of thinkers, paralysis is most explicitly central in Siegfried Kracauer, particularly by 1947 and From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film, where it forms his key category for periodizing cinema according to the collective stasis he saw as pivotal to the emergence and stabilization of fascism. (Indeed, for Kracauer, the “decline of the German screen is nothing but the reflection of a widespread inner paralysis.” ) Lastly, however, we shouldn’t treat the use of paralysis as a trope unique to a critique of bourgeois morals and of conservative fantasies of decadence: it is also highly active in them. It is, for instance, thoroughly prevalent in Mein Kampf, in multiple formulations of how “fighting vigor” and “the instinct of national self-preservation” are halted by various paralyses—including a “creeping paralysis”—caused by pacifism, races seen as degenerate, modernity, and all the other scapegoats to be expected from a fascist imaginary. We can also find a striking instance of its role in the anxieties of American white supremacism, as in the letter from Walter Jones to Secretary of State James Monroe in 1814, which obsesses over how the “disaffection of the blacks is daily gaining extent & boldness,” giving evidence of how the “same heedless Imbecility that destroys our Efforts against the external Enemy [in the war of 1812], paralyses every thing like vigilance & Police.”

Yet if these instances all to a greater or lesser degree preserve the basic metaphor of individual paralysis as a way to frame the mass or the body politic, we can see something adjacent but critically different in the next major version: paralysis as a breakdown of political decision-making. Some iterations continue to pay attention to the consequences of “analysis paralysis,” such as Mikhail Bakunin’s diagnosis of the failure of political decision within the Paris Commune, caused by those who could not “overcome and subdue many of their own bourgeois prejudices.” (Unable to take decisive action and “go beyond generalities,” the result was that “they were paralyzed, and they paralyzed the Commune.” ) But more potently, this version of the paralysis trope gives a name to the familiar snarl of procedure and bureaucracy that generates its own inability to either take action or respond to input. In large part, and as the sheer inutility of the American legislative branch shows, this can become endemic, a general stasis that contributes to the general erosion of faith in mainstream politics. This paralysis is not solely accidental, not just a side effect of red tape that grinds progress to a halt. It also is actively wielded as threat and tool through which procedures and measures of alleged balance allow individuals to entirely sever the connection between proposed action, which may well have near-total consensus or public support behind it, and actual next steps taken. In his critique of Tommy Tuberville’s one-man blockade of military nominations, Rep. Michael McCaul, Republican from Texas, insisted that, “to hold up the top brass from being promoted and lower brass, I think, is paralyzing our Department of Defense.” Conversely, Rosa Luxemburg, writing in 1918, argued that the “imperialist capitalist class”—to which McCaul and Tuberville alike most certainly belong—deploys not just “brutality” (and “will mobilize heaven and hell against the proletariat”) but also will “try to paralyze every socialist measure with a thousand methods of passive resistance.” And among those passive forms, we must include the use of political form itself. Analogously to what Max Liebermann warned for painting in 1904 (“The paralysis of form into dogma would be the paralysis of art itself, would be its death” ), Luxemburg’s analysis opens towards an astute political imaginary of the dangers of bureaucratic formalism itself, including socialist parties and labor unions. Indeed, this is what Leon Trotsky identifies in 1938: “Leading political organizations … do everything possible to keep in check and paralyze the revolutionary pressure of the masses.” And taking this further, we can see, within anarchist and left-communist lines of thought, a suspicion of not just specific organizational forms but also the dangers of any separation of elected representatives from “the masses” they purport to represent in the first place. Peter Kropotkin, writing also of the Paris Commune, suggests that, Paris having “sent her devoted sons to the town hall,” those representatives lost “the inspiration which only comes from continual contact with the masses, [and] they saw themselves reduced to impotence. Being paralyzed by their separation from the people—the revolutionary center of light and heat—they themselves paralyzed the popular initiative.” His deployment of the trope is precise here, insofar as it centers, like in Adorno’s text, not on the paralysis of some specific individual or group but on the way paralysis is generated by a failure of connection, a breakdown of the necessary feedback between information, critique, and action that leaves the revolution stranded in those “empty, paralyzed intervals.”

We can move from this to the final two tendencies where the trope of paralysis gets used even more consistently: the paralysis of technical infrastructure, particularly in its failure or blackout, and the paralysis of the reproduction of capital, especially when caused by a strike, blockade, or disabling of key elements. Regarding the former, these instances of infrastructural dysfunction can be an un-authored breakdown, just the inevitable consequence of the tight coupling of a system, its lack of adequate fail-safes, and, in the case of electrical grids, the sheer length of cable versus the cussed determination of squirrels to gnaw and burrow. Consider, for instance, David Nye’s excellent work on such blackouts, where paralysis is the term and notion returned to again and again; or how it appears in Brittle Power: Energy Strategy for National Security, a 1982 Pentagon study rereleased after 9/11, which details how the “disagreeable lack of resilience and a high cost of failure” of “centralized computers” results in “whole corporations, including such time-sensitive ones as airlines and banks [being] paralyzed.” Attention to this use of the idea also lets us detect one of the most crucial aspects of how paralysis is imagined in general beyond its bodily referent: the sense that it is only in the interval of breakdown that the unseen centrality of what reproduces daily life comes to the fore. As Stephen Graham puts it, “Paradoxically, it is the moment when the blackout occurs, when the server is down, when the subway workers strike or the water pipe ceases to function, that the dependence of cities on infrastructure becomes most visible.”

However, paralysis is used even more pointedly in the language of military operations—whether by sovereign or insurgent forces—that aim to actively produce these situations of paralysis. A full accounting of this would be far too long, so I will only note here two crucial and recurrent elements. The first, as evidenced in the 1992 thesis of US Air Force Major Jason Barlow, is a focus on the specific capacity of airpower—i.e., bombing— to induce “strategic paralysis,” which involves targeting the connective mechanisms that allow a power to continue to wage war. The second is the claim that paralysis—of an army, city, population, or supply chain—is a way to reduce casualties and bring about an end to hostilities with minimal damage. This extends to how purportedly “nonlethal weapons” try to avoid the public spectacle and political cost of civilian death by aiming “to deter, confine, remove from activity, paralyze, confuse, stop, neutralize, distract, disperse, isolate,” and so on from there. Moreover, this sense of the effects on individuals and social infrastructure is key, because it also feeds back into the kind of uncertainty, impasse, and distrust that was identified by many theorists as the danger of a mass paralysis of political possibility. Cyberwar—which inherits the consistent language of paralysis, especially because of its ability to disable without causing physical or visible damage—directly weaponizes this confusion. An account of a 1997 internally authorized test hack of the Pentagon and the electrical grid details how the “hackers also managed to infect the human command-and-control system with a paralyzing level of mistrust. Orders that appeared to come from a commanding general were fake, as were bogus news reports on the crisis and instructions from the civilian command authorities.” Moreover, such an attack obscures the simple clarity of source, or of even coming from hostile intent, let alone a sovereign power. As Wei Jincheng points out, “An information war is inexpensive, as the enemy country can receive a paralyzing blow through the Internet, and the party on the receiving end will not be able to tell whether it is a child’s prank or an attack from an enemy.”

However, imperialist powers have no lock on infrastructural paralysis. If anything, as the cunning involved suggests, it has been historically employed by those with less firepower and fewer resources, forming a critical tactic of anti-imperial fighters whom occupying forces try to destroy (yet whom they ultimately learn from and imitate). We can trace the idea through long histories of attacks on colonizers and energy, transport, and supply-chain infrastructures alike. For example, in 1999, the Nigerian environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey spoke of the “need to organise Niger Delta-wide days of action to build up to a climax which would be represented in continuous mass action around oil and gas installations effectively shutting the flow stations and paralysing the activities of transnational capital.” And if Cabral saw colonization as productive of a cultural paralysis, he advocated infrastructural paralysis in return. Guerrilla bases should be located “mainly at strategic points in such a way as to paralyse the enemy and to threaten them on all sides, wherever they are.” Armed action should extend

to our urban centres (cities and towns) to sow insecurity among the enemy … Shell the enemy barracks, even shell the market places of towns and cities, create conditions which paralyse any commercial activity, make swift and energetic raids, carry out acts of sabotage against camps, offices, petrol stocks, water reserves, troop carriers and administration transport, etc. But for the time being avoid any act of terrorism against the unarmed European or African population.

Here again is evidence of what will become so central to the trope across the twentieth century: taking action to produce inaction and to neutralize the capacities of a system to maintain a way of life, but in a way that separates this from primarily taking lives.

Lastly, the paralysis of capital. This is arguably the single most consistent, yet still largely unexamined, use of the idea, appearing again and again in the language of organizers and historians alike to describe the effect of the withdrawal of labor (or the disabling of tools of labor) that results in the temporary breakdown in circulation. Even more than the other versions, there are simply too many examples of this to traverse from the last century and a half. It is omnipresent across both significant labor histories and mainstream reporting on strikes, and from quite different moments. Louie Adamic’s Dynamite: The Story of Class Violence in America (1931, revised in 1934) speaks of the way that the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 leads to “the entire system [being] paralyzed,” while the newspapers he quotes also use the same language, bemoaning how “business is fairly paralyzed here.” Beverly J. Silver’s Forces of Labor: Workers’ Movements and Globalization Since 1870, published seven decades after Adamic’s volume, writes of a UAW strike in 1937 that “paralyzed GM’s Fisher Body Plant” and quotes the New York Times’ account of another GM strike in 1997 that, in their words, “virtually paralyzed” operations. A postal official says of the effect of strikes in 1970 that “we’re very close to paralysis … what is still functioning is hardly worthy of calling a postal system,” while CNBC writes of the 2015 “paralysis” of West Coast ports. The term is used liberally by those who condemn its use as a tactic, like the anti-syndicalists James Boyle (who argues that the general strike is used “to cripple and ruin employers, and to paralyze the industries of the country”) and John Spargo (“This social cataclysm is to take the form of the General Strike, when the proletariat paralyzes society by becoming motionless”). It is used equally by those who celebrate it, again and again, from workerists to anarchists, Wobblies to forest defenders. And notably, it’s a central category for theorists of sabotage, for those who articulated a defense of one of the most demonized tactics and forms of political thought in the last century. Across their accounts, it becomes not a synonym for sabotage but the word used to describe the interval it produces, in which significant damage is done to efficiency and profits alone, rather than to individual persons or even to machinery. Emile Pouget, largely responsible for the formal posing of sabotage and who argues for “Intelligent Paralyzation Versus Stupid Destruction,” insists that

sabotage must be directed against the boss either by reducing the output or by deteriorating and making unusable the product or by disabling and paralyzing the instruments of production—but the consumer, we repeat, must never suffer by this war waged exclusively against the exploiter.

Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who I’d argue was the twentieth century’s most compelling theorist of sabotage, turns to the idea of paralysis multiple times throughout her texts and speeches. In one instance, which shows the same distinction between paralysis and physical danger or violence, she suggests that “mass action is far more up-to date than personal or physical violence. Mass action means that the workers withdraw their labor power, and paralyze the wealth production of the city, cut off the means of life, the breath of life of the employers.”

Six decades later, in a context where Italian feminists had to articulate the way that the work of social reproduction was not only productive of value but at the very heart of the maintenance and circulation of capital itself, the Emilia Romagna’s Coordinating Committee for Wages for Domestic Work writes that “if we went on a strike we would not leave unfinished products or raw materials untransformed etc.: by interrupting our work we wouldn’t paralyse the production but the daily reproduction of the working class.” And for the perpetuity of a social order that requires gendered exploitation to function, it is this paralysis—not the bombing of hospitals, not the disabling of servers, not the panic of individuals unable to respond—that is most frightening of all.

What, then, to do with paralysis? What sense to make of its appearance across these registers, a recurrence so regular and widespread that it can’t be chalked up to mere rhetorical flourish or vivid simile? For a start, we can note a striking consistency to its various uses, enough to detect a specific quality at the heart of what the idea does and why it can’t be left alone. Namely, paralysis has become one of the central figures of thought used to talk and think about the failure of politics itself. It gets deployed to reckon with what fails to function, or to be adequately managed, within the expected terrain, parameters, and protocols of political activity—and especially within a framework that hinges on elected representation and the promise of an engaged public of individual citizens. Yet its specificity doesn’t lie in that failure itself. As daily experience and the trope of paralysis itself draw out, such continual disconnection, incoherence, and impasse is the ground of contemporary electoral politics, not the exception. So what is particular is how these often apolitical and at times anti-political processes generate profound effects by disrupting or weaponizing the infrastructures, patterns, and flows that themselves must function as the basic ground for the reproduction of any social, let alone political, system or life. In other words, paralysis names the threat of an agency that starts where politics ends.

Indeed, we can note this sense of paralysis as something extra-political across all the uses I detailed earlier, including those that are felt in the most intimate way. For instance, that alternately animating/petrifying force of fear, fascination, indecision, or trauma erodes the illusion of a rational zone of civic engagement. How? The standard conception of politics that underwrites contemporary liberal capitalist societies is one that relies on the premise and promise that measured thought will translate into reasonable and calculated response or action, and from there into an equitable public exchange. But nothing names the threatened breakdown of that so clearly as the trope of paralysis, as it specifies the disruption of that very conduit between thought and action, as well as any idea that simply “knowing better” will result in a more balanced, rational interaction. To be paralyzed with fear or in a distressed stasis of indecision is neither to misunderstand a situation nor to lack enough education to understand better. It is to have understanding cease to be enough, because the pathways that might lead from intent to act have been nullified.

The sense of the extra-political is also and more obviously active in the paralysis of political decision-making. Here the mechanisms and organizational forms designed to facilitate decision-making—and indeed, to overcome “mass paralysis” and achieve progress—become what damns that possibility. The result is a sheer morass of legislative procedure, inflexible hierarchies and priorities, and a corrosive doubt about the ability of anything that gets called “politics” to do more than spin in circles. Filibusters spool out and out, default looms behind blown deadlines, and committees can’t decide if they are voting to take a vote or just actually voting. As a result, the frequent paralyses of political process, from a government shutdown to the incapacity of a union to recognize and channel the dissent of its members, make evident that any sense of collective agency will need to exit the sanctioned terrain of the political, at least insofar as that terrain is bordered by strictures of law, procedure, and elected officials. And fittingly, when it does so, the tactics turned to are those themselves understood as trying to produce intervals of economic and social paralysis: direct action, disruption of supply chains, blockades and pickets, refusal of expected but unrecognized labor.

Lastly, with regards to “strategic paralysis,” guerrilla attacks on infrastructure, cyberwar, and the withdrawal of labor or use of strikes to block circulation, there is a willful exit from any possible diplomacy or negotiation. Representation is quit in favor of the blunt fact of how goods move, how data transfers, how water flows, and who, as much as what, forms the vital points of transformation and connection through those operational sequences. Yet more than that, this is an exit also from conventional theaters of military engagement into a terrain that shows itself disarmingly borderless. If the paralysis of politics leaves behind the fixation on the square, the forum, and the parliament, the martial paralysis of communication turns from the battlefield to the infrastructures, both social and technical, of capital and daily life alike. Even before contemporary military operations and cyberwar recasts all quotidian space into a possible threatscape, paralytic tactics read the between for what it can do to what it is supposed to support. The same can be said for the paralysis of capital, which carries out this kind of reading on itself. It moves not only beyond legislation into the plain question of whether work does or does not get done and the harder calculus of how long who can hold out; it also asks: What does it means to strike in sites and times that unions, parties, and theorists alike refuse to recognize as legitimate or as where labor even happens?

Yet there is another terrain here that remains consistently unacknowledged. This is the gap between the metaphors of paralysis—like those used to talk about networks, machines, and bureaucracies—and the actual corporeal and social experiences of being paralyzed, experiences that are exceptionally nonmetaphorical. If, in the influential framing of David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder, disability gets deployed in discourses as a “narrative prosthesis,” then paralysis shows itself to be a prosthesis of peculiar importance and recurrence, one that can be stunningly indifferent to what it is to live with a paralyzing impairment in a world steadfastly built counter to adequate support. However, I don’t think we can reduce the use of paralysis as a trope, especially within anarchist, anti-colonial, and socialist history, to just a callous ignorance of the lived experiences of paralyzing impairments, even though the discourse of those histories is consistently marked by ableist imaginaries shaping ideas of what and who should take precedence in processes of struggle and liberation. Rather, this tension between the physical and the symbolic is part of a complicated net of relations that is central to the very idea of paralysis itself. I consider these along three lines. First, and what will be my primary focus in the next installment of this essay, is exactly this question of disability, debilitation, and its centrality to histories of capital and empire. More specifically, I’ll examine the way that processes of war, labor, and circulation—the ones that get spoken about through paralysis—not only perpetuate processes of damage that can be literally paralyzing but also constitute a system that legally and materially generates these kind of uneasy equivalences between humans, systems, machinery, and spaces.

Second, paying closer attention to the trope of paralysis shows that its meaning points in a substantially different direction from the other familiar ableist metaphors of crippling, hobbling, blinding, and hamstringing. All of those suggest an injury that is both grievous and obvious, a violence done to capacity in a way that is permanent (or at least that will require a long period of recovery) and, crucially, that can immediately be seen and proven. But as shown by my sketch of how the trope gets used, paralysis’s breakdown of the ability to react or function is above all temporary: it is seen either to produce no physical damage—such as the labor strike or cyberattack—or to do so tactically and minimally, only at points of connection whose disabling will produce exponentially greater consequences without the attacker being seen to maim, kill, or destroy.

Still from Solidarity, directed by Joyce Wieland, 1973.

So counter to “being paralyzed” as a potent image of permanence, like being in the wake of significant spinal trauma, paralysis as a name for extra-political breakdown names something closer to a drug, a paralyzing toxin, “knockout drops,” or a targeted nerve. It is a term for what is able to temporarily produce that lag or noise between expected points in a circuit, in the communication of commodities and data alike. But if this language sounds too cybernetic or austere, too immaterial or digital, I should stress that the acts that make these moments are plainly and obstinately physical, and often exhaustingly so. They mean waiting in the rain to block a port, or stretching funds to make a strike hold out and out, or uncoupling the rails from their ties to keep scab trains from rolling through. We can think of the feet in Joyce Wieland’s Solidarity, her 1973 film about a factory strike in Ontario. Because while the speeches and chants unfold, and people try to spur enthusiasm against the gradual leeching of energy that comes from not just an afternoon but days and weeks and months, the camera holds on the feet of the crowd, as they shuffle and strain and, every so often, lift from the ground to try and work blood back into what goes numb from staying still too long.

The third complication of metaphor and meaning, however, concerns the terms of that very operation I’ve been detailing, where a cultural meaning drifts free from, or combines in strange ways with, a lived relation to physical and mental experience. Because when we dwell on paralysis, it becomes apparent that it isn’t just one instance among many where we can detect a dislocation of experience and representation happening, as in the various narrative uses of disability. Rather, paralysis is specifically a trope about that very drift, collapse, and confusion, naming nothing so much as the unexpected frictions and interference between, on one hand, information, signal, language, or code, and, on the other, a reaction or action that is manifestly corporeal or material. So if it is a metaphor, it’s a metaphor about what happens when it is impossible to draw a clean divide between what is “just a metaphor” and what hurts. It is about the temporary loss of a stable and assured relation between what a word, code, or signal is supposed to represent or activate, and the muscle, turbine, or human workforce that is supposed to respond to it, through the intervening technical form that translates between them, whether that is digital or managerial.

Some of the critical resources I already detailed are caught in this from the beginning, and often in ways that fail them. For instance, if psychoanalysis already suggests a complicated relationship between the symbolic and the physical, we can see how much that tension was largely answered in that field through a primacy of the former, a commitment to a dephysicalized topology of the psyche, and a focus on the production of undesired bodily effects through structures of desire and language themselves. In this regard, Catherine Malabou’s corrective around “cerebrality,” and the way it poses anew the traumatic physicality of thought that cannot be seen within the parameters of the symbolic, is crucial, not as an attack on the entire framework of psychoanalysis but as an insistence that we keep reopening the question of the material and the informational. Yet I want to end here further from critical theory and with a single text that in many ways holds all the contradictions in what I’ve been tracking across these fields and histories. Because in the time that I’ve been attuned to the idea of paralysis, one of the instances that has stayed with me the most comes near the end of Ricardo Piglia’s 1997 novel Burnt Money (Plata quemada).

The novel is based largely on an actual armored-car robbery in 1965 in Buenos Aires, and it centers on two men who are lovers. When one is shot during the robbery, it provokes the other to kill the car’s guards in revenge, which brings in turn a massive effort by the state to kill them. By the end of the novel, the robbers are holed up in an apartment, under siege and waiting for the next attempt by police to storm the place. And although this is not the only mention of “paralysis” in the book (as we get the formulation paralizado de terror several times), it is this scene, the one that gives the novel its title, that is worth quoting in full:

They began throwing burning thousand peso bills out of the window. From the kitchen skylight they could get the burning money to float down over the corner. The burning bills, they looked like butterflies of fire. A murmur of indignation raged through the crowd. “They’re burning it.” “They’re burning the money.” If the money was all that justified the deaths, and if what they had done they had done just for money, and now they are burning it, that means they have no morals, no motives, that they act and kill gratuitously, for pleasure, from pure evil, that they are born killers, cold criminals, inhuman. Indignant, the citizens watching the scene cried out in horror and hatred, as if (according to the newspapers) in some sort of medieval witches’ sabbath; they could not bear to watch nearly half a million dollars burn before their eyes in an operation that paralyzed the city and nation in horror [que paralizó de horror a la ciudad y al país] and that lasted for fifteen interminable minutes, the time it takes to burn that astronomical amount of money, those bills which for reasons beyond the control of the authorities were destroyed in a metal can that in Uruguay is called a patona usually used to remove the coal from beneath a hot grill.

There is so much at stake and at work here, an entire theory of paralysis in just these remarkable paragraphs. As a way into that, we might start with the time it takes: “fifteen interminable minutes.” This drawn-out duration of methodical burning is crucial not only for the way it challenges any sense of paralysis as a sudden, event-like shock but also for the blunt materiality of “the time it takes to burn that astronomical amount of money.” Because what we see in this is simultaneously a confirmation of the tremendous symbolic value assured by the state (“nearly half a million dollars”) and a collapse of that value, of its fictional autonomy and immateriality. Money is shown to be something that can in fact be burned, that is neither sovereign nor transcendent but just paper and ink, and that takes an “interminable” amount of time to torch simply because unlike the digital wiping of a balance, you can only rush fire so far. It is in this space, and in the witnessing of this immolation, that paralysis becomes the word Piglia uses, and rightly so. If, in Furio Jesi’s generative account of the Spartacist uprising, revolt produces a suspension of historical time, then the burning of this money, and the sight of it drifting aflame from the open window above, produces a momentary paralysis of social time. By that I mean both the time naturalized by the social relations of capital—the temporal ordering and valuing it enacts and props up through wages, property, debt, and policing—and the social imaginary of other forms that could be possible were it not for the dominance of capital’s organization of life. However, the collapse here does not generate some vista of a glorious beyond. Instead, it appears under the sign of what is meaningless and stupid, all the bloodshed not worth it even within some arcane metric of financial worth, and so senseless that it extends to the money itself, which is shown to be paper, just paper, nothing more, and then not even that, just ash. When economic value, the most powerful unit of information in the world, ceases to organize what happens and goes up in literal smoke, how can one not be stopped, alive in one’s tracks?

Yet here there is also anger, as the “indignant crowd immediately thought of the needy, the poor, those living in the Uruguayan countryside in precarious circumstances, and the orphans for whom that money might have guaranteed a future.” This fury comes close to becoming what we might recognize as conventionally political, for the obvious next step would be to say that money should not be needed to guarantee that future. How dare they burn money teeters on the knife’s edge of another thought: How dare money be the arbiter of who should be able to not merely survive but flourish. After all, the same state whose existence alone guarantees the value of the bills could also declare the worth of those living in precarious circumstances. It could organize the defense of that life beyond value.

It could. But it doesn’t and won’t. The brilliance of Piglia’s account is to refuse any easy and hopeful turn, as if the sight of the cash aflame would spark speculation on the injustices of the financial sphere and its relation to nationhood. Instead, the shock of the moment is total, violent not for the deaths animated by money but for how it tears open those socially assured bonds of value and brings into the open the way that the historicity of money vanishes daily into its use. And so, in the shock of that moment, “everyone understood that the act was a declaration of total war, a direct, well-organized war against society as a whole.” Yet again, rather than pointing towards what in society deserves to have war waged against it, it is the waste of money alone, in its burning, that becomes the act to blame, the thing deserving fury.

The most striking thing about what Piglia does here, and why I keep coming back to this passage, is to show how in the wake of this interval of paralysis, when time unfreezes and words return to mouths, what comes to the fore is a set of seeming category errors and blurrings between the economic, the inorganic, the vital, and the punishable. We see a first glimpse of this with the “butterflies of fire,” but the money continues to shape-shift: “Someone had the idea that the money itself was innocent, even if it had been the result of killing and crime, it should not be considered guilty but neutral, a sign whose function depended on the use to which it was put.” And it doesn’t stop there, opening through the comments of the crowd into a symbolic chain of metaphors and slippages. The burning of “innocent money is an act of cannibalism,” while the men behind this “should be burnt to a cinder, slowly,” as if money was flesh and fire was eating, as if you are what you stole. Everything collapses together. But it doesn’t do so as a mere confusion in the aftermath of the horrifying spectacle, a stretching for fantastic language to describe what boggles the mind. Instead, I’d suggest that what it touches, so briefly, are the real links that are already present, the ones that bind together paper and value, work and flesh, and all the points in the circulation of capital to each other through a million hands, cables, words, and algorithms. It is a fleeting glimpse into the systems that underwrite the reproduction of a social order that actually does treat bodies like machines and butterflies like trash, networks like nerves and pesos like angels. At least in the suspended space of literature, this is a tiny window opening onto paralysis and its confusions and animations, onto possible actions that do not stay within representation but instead go for the junctures in the infrastructure supporting it.

That moment doesn’t last though. And what is it that restores motion, that slams the door on the sight of money being burned as if it was as truly worthless as it deserves to be? It is the cops, they who alone “seemed to react,” who then prepare a “brutal offensive.” In this too the novel feels as lucid as it is bleak. Those who are responsible for the bloody maintenance of the borders of property and culpability exit the pause of paralysis not into reflection or critique or refashioning, but into sanctioned violence, the kind that closes off that interval and the inhuman relations seething within it.'",climate,drought

"'Firefighters from two counties, along with the Department of Conservation and Environmental Resources, battled a wildfire that broke out around 2:30 p.m. Sunday on the mountainside north of North Avenue in Jim Thorpe.

The Mount Pisgah fire was brought under control around 6:30 p.m.

According to the DCNR, the fire was started by a resident burning brush.

The property owner called emergency responders around 2:30 p.m. to report that his debris fire near intersection of North and Pine Avenues in Jim Thorpe was spreading.

Soon thereafter, volunteer crews from the Jim Thorpe Fire Department arrived.

Fueled by winds, the flames began burning onto the slope and toward Nesquehoning.

Fire personnel used UTVs, brush trucks and tankers to attack the 4-acre fire. No injuries or property damage were reported.

Based on the windy conditions, DCNR said the fire could have been much worse and credited the great response and hard work of the volunteer fire departments.

The fire brought response from Carbon and Schuylkill counties, including volunteers from Jim Thorpe, Franklin, Lehighton, Nesquehoning, Mahoning Valley, Summit Hill, Lansford, Coaldale, and Penn Forest fire companies.

Firefighters were on the scene of a wildfire that broke out on Mount Pisgah in Jim Thorpe Sunday afternoon. A smaller fire happened in Mahoning Township earlier in the day. See page 4 for details. COPYRIGHT LARRY NEFF/SPECIAL TO THE TIMES NEWS

"'As COP28 takes place in Dubai from November 30 to December 12, it brings together the world at a critical moment for global transformative climate action. Last year’s COP27 made progress with the creation of a loss and damage fund to provide financial assistance to developing nations hit by climate disaster. The timing is perfect as Thailand takes action to enhance water security measures because of increasing risks due to floods and droughts .

Thailand has been a development success story – known for its tourism, economic development, education and centers of excellence. But its risks and vulnerabilities have increased through the years because of climate change. Data show temperature increases since the middle of the 20th century while precipitation events have been less frequent but more intense. Model projections suggest increased flood risks during the wet season and more severe water shortages. Thailand currently ranks ninth globally in the INFORM Index of Risk from floods .

Floods are by far the country’s greatest natural hazard in terms of socio-economic impacts. The 2011 floods caused 680 deaths and affected nearly 13 million people. Moreover, it resulted in damages and economic losses worth an estimated US $46.5 billion, equivalent to 12.6 percent of GDP. Severe floods in October 2022 resulted in government relief spending of US $663 million, or 0.13 percent of GDP.

The country also frequently suffers from droughts resulting from a shortage of rainfall, reduced flow in surface and sub-surface rivers, and poor land management practices. Severe droughts in 1979, 1994, 1999, and 2015 impaired the country. The northeastern region with the highest poverty rates is particularly vulnerable.

The 2011 flooding was a turning point and a wake-up call. Learning from this, the Thai government has been investing in more sustainable and resilient water management systems. It also integrated climate change in water resources management in order to prepare systematic plans for responding to extreme water events. This response combines adaptation to cope with increased risks due to climate change; it also includes mitigation to reduce climate change impacts. The Royal Irrigation Department has studied the underlying causes of floods and developed an integrated and multi-pronged program to improve flood control in the greater Bangkok area.

This program, called the “Chao Phraya 9 Plans”, includes comprehensive water management investments with an estimated cost of US$ 9.4 billion. It will provide flood protection for the country’s most important river basin which is a source of half of the country’s agricultural production and economic life. It will also increase its hydraulic capacity to channel floods through the basin with lower risks to life and property.

The World Bank is in discussions with the Government for providing support to the 9 Plans Program, starting with financing for implementation of Plan 1. Plan 1 investments include improvement of 23 channels and related hydraulic infrastructure over a length of 494 km, for a budget of US$ 1.85 billion. The goal is to double the drainage capacity from 210 cubic meters per second to 400 cubic meters per second, from the Rama 6 diversion dam to the Gulf of Thailand. It will also increase storage capacity for use during the dry season by 18 million cubic meters per year, and protect about 44,160 ha of land area.

While the government has made much progress to better cope with floods and droughts, certain challenges remain. There is a need to accelerate the implementation of the Royal Initiative for Flood Management. This provides more areas for water retention and establishes a robust data and information management system. Strengthening flood forecasting and early warning systems that incorporate climate change modeling and hazard mapping are also needed. Land use planning, nature-based solutions and green development, with strong integration of community-led planning and implementation, are effective flood prevention measures. In China, for example, the Yellow River Basin Project significantly reduced flood risk for millions, provided more sustainable land use, prolonged the lives of storage reservoirs and stabilized the river course.



The World Bank supports a sustainable and resilient development pathway for Thailand at this critical juncture. We recently conducted a water sector assessment on identifying the needed water resources management improvements. The latest World Bank Thailand Economic Monitor also focused on coping with El Nino.



The COP28 Presidency and Commissioner expressed their shared conviction that COP28 must accelerate practical action on mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and climate finance that leaves no one behind. This message fully resonates with Thailand’s objective to build a more resilient development pathway and realize its vision of achieving a high-income country status by 2037. The “9 Plans” can potentially improve the lives of millions of Thais. It is also a good working model for countries building resilience via effective flood management measures to prevent climate shocks.

PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas (AP) — TJ Bamba scored 13 points and all of Villanova's starters scored in double figures in beating Memphis 79-63 in the championship game of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament on Friday.

Villanova used a 12-0 run late in the first half to lead by as many as 30 and led by 35 midway through the second half. At that point, Memphis, which shot just 15% in the first half, responded with a press and 21 unanswered points on 9-of-11 shooting led by Jahvon Quinerly's nine points to get within 14 with 4 1/2 minutes to go before the monster rally ended.

Justin Moore, Tyler Burton and Eric Dixon scored 11 points each and Mark Armstrong had 10 for Villanova. The Wildcats (6-1) made 13 of 35 3-point attempts, three apiece from Bamba and Moore. Burton had a game-high nine rebounds.

David Jones scored 13 points, Quinery 12 and Caleb Mills 10 for the Tigers (5-1), who made only 7 of 25 from the arc.

"'NEW YORK — Jonquel Jones and the New York Liberty wouldn’t let the season end just yet.

She scored 27 points and Breanna Stewart added 20 to help the New York Liberty beat the Las Vegas Aces 87-73 on Sunday in the WNBA Finals and force a Game 4.

“I was doing whatever I can to make sure this team gets the win,” Jones said.

New York struggled in the first two games against the Aces in Las Vegas, but the Liberty found their shooting touch in Game 3 behind Jones, who hit four of the team’s 13 3-pointers.

“She was huge for us,” Liberty coach Sandy Brondello said of Jones, who came to the Liberty in a trade in the offseason. “Those 3’s changed the moment of the game a bit. The ball went in. Other games the ball weren’t going in for us. We got back to our identity. Proud of the effort and commitment and connection we had. Now we’ve got to do it again.”

This was the Liberty‘s first win in the WNBA Finals since Teresa Weatherspoon’s half-court shot in Game 2 against Houston in 1999. The Aces are up 2-1 in the best-of-five series and Game 4 is Wednesday night in New York.

The Liberty led by three at halftime before scoring the first eight points of the third quarter to take a double-digit lead, bringing the crowd of 17,143 to its feet. They led 61-50 after three quarters.

Behind A’ja Wilson, the Aces got to within six before Stewart hit a turnaround jumper and Betnijah Laney stole the ball from Jackie Young at half court and made a layup to extend the lead back to 10.

Las Vegas didn’t challenge the rest of the way and star guard Chelsea Gray went back to the locker room midway through the fourth quarter after inuring her foot.

“I can’t give you an update, I’ll let you know when we know,” Las Vegas coach Becky Hammon said.

Kelsey Plum scored 29 points and Wilson added 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Aces, who are looking to become the first team to win consecutive titles since the 2001-02 Los Angeles Sparks. That came on the heels of the Houston Comets winning the WNBA’s first four championships.

“This is a good team we’re talking about, obviously a different feeling in their place,” Wilson said of the Liberty. “We still have a chance to take care of business.”

The Aces had won their first seven games this postseason by an average of 17.3 points. They were looking to become the first team to go 8-0 in a WNBA postseason and the first to not lose a game since Seattle in 2020.

The first two games of the series, as well as the four regular-season meetings, were all blowouts, with the closest game being a nine-point win by New York on Aug. 28. That was the last loss the Aces had until Sunday.

New York had stretches of playing well in the first half, buoyed by the sellout crowd that included NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as well as basketball greats Dawn Staley, Sue Bird and Tony Parker. The Liberty extended their lead to 41-34 on Jones‘ layup with 2:27 left in the half before the Aces got within 43-40 at the break. Jones had 16 points in the first half while Plum scored 15.

BIG APPLE BASKETBALL IS BACK

This was the first WNBA Finals game in New York since 2002, when the Liberty were swept by the Sparks. Hammon was playing on that New York squad and remembers how excited the city was amid the team’s success. No New York basketball team in either the NBA or WNBA has made it that far since.

“This is New York City, this is a basketball mecca. It’s good when all the sports teams do good. The Nets, the Knicks, the Liberty,” Hammon said. “It’s a basketball town. Fans here, they want and expect good basketball. When you don’t put it on the floor, they’ll let you know about it, too.”

Liberty greats Vickie Johnson, Crystal Robinson, Sue Wicks and Weatherspoon, who played with Hammon on New York‘s previous Finals teams, were all in attendance and received a loud ovation from the crowd when they were introduced in the third quarter. New York‘s coach at that time, Richie Adubato, was also in the crowd.

Weatherspoon walked by the media scrum postgame with Sabrina Ionescu and shook her hand.

"'The family-run Arden Hills private club and resort — which for generations has fostered Olympic swim athletes and professional tennis players among its Sacramento suburban member families — is being acquired by a national chain of athletic clubs and gyms after 69 years of local control.

“Sadly, after nearly 70 years, Arden Hills will cease its operations as of December 31, 2023,” the club’s acting executive director, Austin Favero, said in a letter to members. The Favero family has owned the club since 1985.

Terms of the sale for the Fair Oaks Boulevard icon, including the price paid, were not disclosed.

The buyer, Life Time — which operates 170 clubs in the U.S. and Canada, including facilities in Roseville and Folsom — will rebrand the 8.78-acre resort on the border of Arden Arcade and Carmichael as Life Time Arden when the company takes over next year, said Favero, whose family purchased the resort from legendary swimming coach Sherm Chavoor.

Arden Hills, which opened in 1954 as a modest neighborhood athletic club that has expanded over the years to include multiple pools, a day spa, lodging and manicured grounds, calls itself “the only resort-style private club,” in the capital region. Arden Hills was the go-to spot for events such as bridal showers and has hosted thousands of weddings, according to the club’s website. The operators stopped hosting weddings and other social functions earlier this year, according to Sacramento Business Journal.

In 1992, Arden Hills broke away from other private clubs in the region, such as Del Norte and Park Terrace, to embark on an ambitious plan to double its size and offer more amenities such as a 20,000-square-foot indoor pool, spa and dining facilities. It also sold some of its land to build luxury homes.

COVID dealt financial blow to Arden Hills

Despite the successes in transforming Arden Hills from a community private club to a year-round resort, Arden Hills suffered greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic, the owner said in the letter to members.

“As we approached 2020, the club was thriving, and our family was in the process of passing the torch to the next generation, eager to continue the club’s success for decades to come,” the family said. “Yet, as fate would have it, a curveball was thrown our way.”

The operators said that “every facet of Arden Hills, from the gym to the spa, weddings and events, restaurants, and lodging, found itself directly in the cross hairs of the worldwide shutdown.”

While the owners had received $1.2 million in federal funds through the Paycheck Protection Program, “it fell far short of making up for the losses,” they said.

“The club had never closed for more than a day for nearly seven decades. Yet, it took over 18 months to fully reopen the gym, the restaurant, and the spa, and three years to navigate the complexities surrounding weddings and events.”

The Favero family said it explored multiple options to weather the crisis including changing its “overall business model, rezoning the property to maximize refinancing potential, and pursuing new investment” but ultimately decided on selling the operations.

“As we diligently worked to recover, it gradually became clear that our previously very successful business model may no longer be viable in a post-COVID world. It also became evident over time that the likelihood of identifying potential investors/buyers for the Arden Hills business had diminished significantly due to the pandemic’s devastating impact on our resources.”

New owner’s plans unclear

The owners decided on Life Time, to “preserve the legacy of this property” and “infuse it with new energy, excitement, and passion.”

Life Time, based in Chanhassen, Minnesota, said in a statement it plans a “phased renovation and transformation of the space with the goal of minimal impact on members.” The new owners said they expected to updated the property, bringing in “best-in-class equipment” as well as “a future renovation of the spa and the dining areas.”

“We are excited to build upon the Arden Hills legacy to create an incredible, high-end athletic country club experience dedicated to empowering healthier, happier lives for members,” Brian Gaeta, a vice president with the chain, said in the statement. “As with all our 170+ destinations across North America, we will provide a breadth of incomparable programming, service and the best experiences as we serve this vibrant community.”

However, details of the plan — including the cost to be a member — remain unknown. Current memberships span the $300-a-month range with upfront initiation costing at least $1,000.

“In the coming weeks, further details on Life Time’s plans, renderings and opportunities to join will be announced. Life Time operates two additional locations in the greater Sacramento market, including Folsom and Roseville, as part of its network of athletic country clubs across North America,” the company said.

Sacramento’s Debbie Meyer holds up an Olympic gold medal and wears another in January 1969. The third one she gave to her coach, Sherm Chavoor, who ran Arden Hills swim club for decades before selling it to the Favero family. With Debbie in this Sacramento Bee file photo is her mother, Betty, and brothers Jeff, 12, and Carl, 8.

An Olympic legacy at Arden Hills

Arden Hills served for decades as a training ground for elite athletes. Swimmers who have trained there have won 22 Olympic gold medals, according to Arden Hills’ website.

The most famous of them: Mark Spitz, Debbie Meyer and Sue Pedersen. Spitz, a Modesto native, was the star of the 1972 Olympics in Munich by winning seven gold medals, each in world-record time. Only American swimmer Michael Phelps has won more golds. Meyer and Pedersen were trained by Sherm Chavoor at the Arden Hills in the 1960s before earning medals at the Mexico City Olympics. Between the two women, they have five gold medals and two silver medals from the 1968 Games and had set several world records.

More recently, tennis pros such as Jenson Brooksby, who battled current No. 1 men’s tennis player Carlos Alcaraz at the U.S. Open in 2022, have also played at the club.'",sports,tennis

"'Serena Williams is reminding us it’s OK not to be OK.

On Tuesday, the tennis champion and mother of two took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to express that she was struggling emotionally.

“I am not OK today,” she began in the post. “And that’s OK to not be OK. No one is OK every single day.”

She added, “If you are not OK today, I’m with you. There’s always tomorrow. Love you.”

The post was met with widespread support from fans and followers. Commiserating commenters thanked Williams, who has been open about her mental health struggles, including prior experience with postpartum depression, for always being open and urged her to look after herself.

Later in the day, Williams followed up with a second post, a photo of her cuddling her newborn daughter Adira with the caption, “This makes me so happy.”

Williams’ choice to cope by taking some time out with her daughter aligns with the 23-time Grand Slam champion’s previous statements on how she manages her mental health. In the August 2022 cover story of Selena Gomez’s Wondermind, Williams shared that she prioritizes taking a pause.

“Mental fitness for me is just really learning to shut down,” she said. “You know, I did this years ago, before mental health was a topic on everyone’s mind.”

She added, ”Now that I know that it is so important to put yourself first—especially mentally—I always have shutdown moments. I have serious boundaries, and I don’t let anyone cross those boundaries with my time.”

Around the same time, Williams announced in Vogue’s September 2022 cover story that she was potentially evolving away from tennis and making way for other things in her life like Serena Ventures, her clothing line S by Serena, and expanding her family.

While Williams has adopted the “shutdown” method, she admitted to Wondermind that she’s still learning how to master the coping strategy, and particularly prioritizing herself.

“I’m terrible at that! I’ve said it time and time again: I’m working on it,” she said. “But, more or less, at least prioritizing what I need to do, and then when I’m turned off, I’m turned off.”

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Veteran outfielder Mark Canha is on the move again, with the Milwaukee Brewers trading him to the Detroit Tigers on Saturday rather than picking up his option for the 2024 season.

The Brewers acquired minor league pitcher Blake Holub in the deal.

Milwaukee was facing a Monday deadline on whether to pick up Canha’s $11.5 million team option for 2024 or pay a $2 million buyout. The Brewers instead dealt Canha to the Tigers, the second time he’s been traded this year.

Canha, who turns 35 on Feb. 15, helped the Brewers in their push for an NL Central title this year after they acquired him from the Mets at the trade deadline. The Mets received minor league pitcher Justin Jarvis in that deal and agreed to pay $3.26 million of Canha’s $3.5 million remaining salary for the year.

In 50 games with the Brewers, Canha batted .287 with a .373 on-base percentage, five homers and 33 RBIs. He produced one of the most memorable moments of the Brewers' season by hitting a tiebreaking grand slam with two outs in the eighth inning of a 9-5 victory over the Washington Nationals on Sept. 16.

Canha had hit .245 with a .343 on-base percentage, six homers and 29 RBIs in 89 games for the Mets before the trade.

He has a career batting average of .250 with a .349 on-base percentage, 113 homers and 417 RBIs. Canha has played for the Oakland Athletics (2015-21), Mets (2022-23) and Brewers (2023).

Houb, a 25-year-old right-hander, went 6-4 with a 3.03 ERA and eight saves in 48 combined relief appearances with Single-A West Michigan and Double-A Erie this season.

"'Sunday’s 2024 WNBA Draft Lottery has potential to be known as the Caitlin Clark Lottery. But Clark, Iowa’s senior star guard, could also decide to return to college next year and wait to enter the WNBA until the 2025 season. Uncertainty surrounds a number of potential top picks, not only Clark, who is presumed to go No. 1 if she declares.

Like last year, when they selected former South Carolina star Aliyah Boston at No. 1, the Indiana Fever enter Sunday with the best odds of obtaining the No. 1 pick (44.2 percent), followed by the Phoenix Mercury (27.6 percent), Los Angeles Sparks (17.8 percent) and Seattle Storm (10.4 percent). The lottery broadcast is scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. ET on ESPN.

What has Clark said about her future?

In early October, Clark said she wasn’t ready to decide if she would return for a fifth season with the Hawkeyes in 2024-25 or turn pro. However, the Iowa star noted she was still going to “treat this year like this is my last year.”

“I’m going to go based off of my gut,” she said. “At the end of the day, that’s the biggest thing that I think I should trust. I’m going to know when I need to know if I want to stay or if I want to go.”

Clark’s scoring numbers have increased this season as she’s averaging a career-high 29.6 points per game on a 45.9 percent shooting from the field. Her 21.8 shot attempts per game are also the most she’s taken throughout her college career. The Hawkeyes are 9-1 and begin conference play Sunday ranked No. 4 in the latest Associated Press poll.

In terms of a decision timeline, in recent years, the WNBA and the Women’s National Basketball Players Association had agreed on an opt-in process for NCAA players who are eligible for the draft but could also return to school. If Clark and the Hawkeyes were to make a second consecutive Final Four in early April, Clark would presumably have 48 hours following the conclusion of their final game to renounce her remaining eligibility and declare for the draft.

“It’s not something I let weigh on me,” Clark said in October. “I’m focused on helping this team be the best team they can be, and when I know that decision, all of you will know. I think the biggest thing will be I’m just going to trust my gut and go with that.”

The 2024 WNBA Draft is scheduled for April 15.

How is the WNBA Draft lottery structured?

Unlike the NBA, WNBA lottery odds are based on the cumulative record of the two most recent regular seasons. Despite winning eight more games in 2023 than they did in 2022, the Fever have a combined 18-58 record over that span and are guaranteed a top-three pick. Last year’s No. 1 pick was Indiana’s first in franchise history.

The Mercury amassed a 24-52 record over the past two seasons, while the Sparks (30-46) and Storm (33-43) have the third- and fourth-worst records over that period. In the drawing itself, 14 balls numbered 1-14 will be placed in a lottery machine and mixed. Four balls then will be drawn to determine a four-digit combination, with the first four-digit number determining the No. 1 pick. The process will then be repeated for the second selection.

The teams with the worst record over the two-year period whose combinations did not come up for the top pick or the second pick will be awarded the third and fourth choices.

Has a team ever won consecutive lotteries?

Yes. The New York Liberty won the 2020 and 2021 draft lotteries, though they traded the 2021 pick to the Storm, who in turn traded it to the Dallas Wings.

The Las Vegas Aces won three consecutive lotteries from 2017 to 2019. Twice, in 2017 and 2018, they entered the lottery with the best odds. In 2019, the Fever had a 44.2 percent chance of earning the top spot, but the Aces, with 27.6 percent odds, were the recipients of the top pick. They formed the foundation of their recent back-to-back championships via the draft, selecting Kelsey Plum, A’ja Wilson and Jackie Young with top picks.

The Storm also won consecutive lotteries ahead of the 2015 and 2016 WNBA drafts, selections they used on stars Jewell Loyd and Breanna Stewart. Seattle also picked first in both the 2001 and 2002 WNBA drafts, taking Lauren Jackson and Sue Bird. However, the WNBA Draft Lottery was first introduced for the 2002 event and was not used in determining the order in 2001.

What are WNBA Draft eligibility rules?

The WNBA’s collective bargaining agreement stipulates, in short, that college players must be 22 years old during the year of the draft, have graduated or will graduate within three months of the draft from a four-year university, or have no remaining eligibility and have her original college class graduated and/or on track to graduate. International players, meanwhile, are eligible for selection if they will be at least 20 during the calendar year in which the given draft is held.

What complicates the situation, however, is that winter sport college athletes who competed during the 2020-21 NCAA season received an additional year of eligibility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. That season was Clark’s freshman year, as it was to a number of other potential top WNBA prospects like Stanford’s Cameron Brink, LSU’s Angel Reese, UConn’s Paige Bueckers and South Carolina’s Kamilla Cardoso.

The WNBA revealed its All-League First Team selections in a Sunday tweet.

Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson, New York Liberty forward Breanna Stewart, Connecticut Sun forward Alyssa Thomas, Minnesota Lynx forward Napheesa Collier and Dallas Wings forward Satou Sabally made up the All-WNBA First Team. Los Angeles Sparks forward Nneka Ogwumike, Aces guards Jackie Young and Chelsea Gray, Seattle Storm guard Jewell Loyd and Liberty guard Sabrina Ionescu were featured on the All-WNBA Second Team.

Wilson, the former No. 1 selection in the 2018 WNBA Draft, was named the league's Defensive Player of the Year in September. She became the first player since former Sparks guard Alana Beard to earn back-to-back selections, according to Jack Maloney of CBS Sports. The two-time WNBA MVP and five-time All-Star averaged a career-high 22.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per game during the 40 games she played and started in during the 2023 regular season.

Stewart won the league's MVP during her first year with the Liberty. The former Seattle Storm forward earned her fifth All-Star selection during a season that saw her average 23 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.6 blocks per game. She took a spot on the All-Defensive First Team, joining Wilson, Thomas, Washington Mystics guard Brittney Sykes and Sparks guard Jordin Canada.

“It's been an unbelievable season for the WNBA, AT and A'ja had amazing seasons, it just shows we're reaching new heights,” Stewart said in September, via The Associated Press National women's basketball writer Doug Feinberg. “That greatness shines in many different ways. That this race was so tight is kind of crazy, but I'm happy to be standing up here today.”

Thomas finished in second place in the league's MVP voting. She set WNBA single-season records for triple-doubles and double-doubles with six and 28 this season, according to an October release from WNBA.com. Sabally won the league's Most Improved Player last month. She received 37 of the 60 possible votes.

"'Ankaragucu's president, Faruk Koca, punched a referee, Halil Umut Meler, in the head before being kicked in the face as he lay on the ground, prompting chaos after the Turkish Super Lig match on Monday night.

The chaos occurred at the end of their home match after Rizespor scored a 97th-minute equalizer.

Koca Punches Meler

The footage from the state broadcaster TRT shows Koca walking onto the pitch and hitting the referee when the final whistle blew in the 1-1 draw at Eryaman Stadium.

Ankaragucu fans interrupted the pitch after the game, and Meler was also kicked when he fell during the following commotion. The police helped Meler to go to the dressing room.

Turkey's football federation (TFF) discussed holding an extraordinary meeting after the trouble on Monday's game. ""Turkish football has been punched shamefully tonight. Everyone involved in this incident will pay the price,"" said the TFF chairman, Mehmet Buyukeksi.

Buyukeksi said in a news conference that matches in all leagues were postponed.

Meler suffered from multiple injuries, including a minor fracture. Koca also required treatment in a hospital, but Interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said that detention procedures would be carried out after his treatment.

Dr. Mehmet Yorubulut said that Meler's injuries were no life threat for the moment, and he was only bleeding around his left eye with a minor fracture. Yorubulut added that they will monitor Meler until the morning due to head trauma. After the necessary examinations, they will discharge him from the hospital in the morning.

Yerlikaya wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that they issued a detention order for Koca and added that two people have already been detained as part of a judicial investigation into the incident.

"'Officials in Hawaii are trying to understand what is causing a coastal pond on Maui to turn pink. There are some indications that drought may be to blame. U.S. Fish and Wildlife staff at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge have been monitoring the water since Oct. 30. pic.twitter.com/3kHOT8xtew — The Associated Press (@AP) November 10, 2023

(CNN) — A pond in Hawaii looks like something right out of a fairy tale. Water at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few coastal salt marshes on the island of Maui, has been bright pink since at least October 30, officials say, after its salt content surged amid an extreme drought.

Water samples sent to the University of Hawaii suggest that halobacteria is behind the pond’s new magenta hue, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in very salty water, like the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. The bacterium is considered a so-called extremophile because of its ability to live in such an extreme environment – in this case, one where the water salinity is twice that of seawater, Fish and Wildlife noted.

While Kealia literally means “salt encrustation,” the pond’s salinity has skyrocketed well beyond normal because of Maui’s extreme drought. The entire island is in severe or worse drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. The area where the Kealia Pond refuge is located is in what’s considered an extreme drought – the second-worst on the Drought Monitor’s scale.

The Waikapu Stream, which brings water from the West Maui Mountains down into the Kealia Pond, also flows through the area of extreme drought. Less freshwater input into the pond has driven the salt concentration up and provided a cozy haven for the brightly hued halobacteria.

Around 90% of Maui County, which includes other islands, is in at least severe drought – one that has grown even worse since a deadly wildfire ripped through Lahaina in August.

Scientists are still studying how the climate crisis will affect Hawaii, but overall there is confidence drought will get worse as global temperature increases – even in tropical areas such as this.

"'By DAN GELSTON

PHILADELPHIA — Bryce Harper smashed the first pitch he saw on his 31st birthday into the seats, Kyle Schwarber hit his first homer of the postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Philadelphia Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series on Monday night.

Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate. Harper, who also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs, hit his 10th homer in two postseasons with the Phillies.

Zack Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending National League champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.

José Alvarado got four big outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the postseason after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.

The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving, deliriously-cheering fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave fans a reason to stop — or a chance for Arizona to catch its breath until it was too late.

Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen’s first pitch 420 feet into the right-field seats. There was some minor consternation that Schwarber — with 47 homers this season and 93 over the last two — had yet to go deep through six playoff games. How easy it was to forget that Schwarber didn’t hit any in the Wild Card Series or NLDS last season before he launched six in the NLCS and World Series. So those Schwarbombs might just be getting started.

Four pitches later, Harper homered — the first time in 127 postseason games Philadelphia went deep twice in the first inning.

When Castellanos lined his fifth homer of the playoffs in the third — all in the past three games — it gave the Phillies 32 home runs in 13 postseason games at Citizens Bank Park over the last two years.

The Kelce Bros approved. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce — minus celebrity friend Taylor Swift — and Eagles center Jason Kelce went wild. Travis pointed to his brother as Jason pounded a beer in their suite.

Gallen, a South Jersey native, had his name derisively drawn out to “Galll-ennnn” by Phillies fans each time the 17-game winner got into a jam. Too many times, for Arizona.

Trea Turner hit a one-double in the third, leaving first base open. Gallen pitched to Harper instead of walking him and got burned by an RBI single for a 4-0 lead.

J.T. Realmuto added an RBI single in the fifth.

Those runs proved crucial for the Phillies. Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run homer off Wheeler in the fifth that made it 5-2.

Seranthony Domínguez opened the door in the seventh for the Diamondbacks when his throwing error on a comebacker led to an unearned run. Alvarado retired pinch-hitter Emmanuel Rivera on a groundout to keep it 5-3 and tossed a scoreless eighth.

COLD DIAMONDBACKS

The wild-card Diamondbacks, who at 84-78 squeezed into the playoffs as the final NL team, were held to four hits.

GOING DEEP

Schwarber’s fourth leadoff homer in the postseason moved him past Jimmy Rollins and Derek Jeter for most in baseball history.

Harper joined St. Louis’ Kolten Wong, Tampa Bay’s Evan Longoria and Kansas City’s Willie Aikens as the only players in postseason history to homer on his birthday.

Castellanos’ five homers in his last three postseason game — he hit two in consecutive games against Atlanta — made him the second player to hit those marks. New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson did it in the 1977 World Series.

UP NEXT

Arizona sends RHP Merrill Kelly (1-0 postseason, 0.00 ERA) to the mound for Game 2.

RHP Aaron Nola (2-0 postseason, 1.42 ERA) pitches for the Phillies. Nola is eligible for free agency after the World Series after he tabled contract extension talks with the team in spring training. Nola made $16 million this year on the club option that was part of the $45 million, four-year deal he signed ahead of the 2019 season. Nola said he wanted to stay in Philadelphia.

“I hope so. I really do,” Nola said before the game. “I love it here. Obviously, it’s the only place I’ve been. I came up through some special times in the rebuilding era ask and getting to witness and be a part of a lot of different type of teams.”'",sports,baseball

"'It was a longball party Wednesday in Philadelphia, as the Phillies clobbered six home runs — tying the record for most in a game in MLB postseason history — en route to a 10-2 Game 3 demolishing of the Braves and a 2-1 lead in this NLDS. They'll have a chance to clinch their ticket for an NLCS return at home in Thursday's Game 4.

It was arguably even more of a longball party later on in Arizona. The Diamondbacks slugged four homers in one inning — setting an MLB postseason record — en route to a 4-2 victory and a 3-0 series sweep, sending them on to the NLCS for the first time since 2007 and the Dodgers home for a long winter.

No. 2 Los Angeles Dodgers at No. 6 Arizona Diamondbacks, Game 3: D-backs 4, Dodgers 2 (Arizona wins 3-0)

Game summary:

The Diamondbacks have ended the Dodgers’ season. They didn’t make it look particularly difficult.

After steamrolling Clayton Kershaw in Game 1 and pouncing on Bobby Miller in Game 2, the D-backs made history against Lance Lynn (more on that below), getting all the runs they would need in the third inning and further pushing the Dodgers' pitching staff into ignominy for the series. Per Elias Sports Bureau, no team has ever received fewer innings from its starting pitchers in the first three games of a series than the 4⅔ contributed by Dodgers starters in this NLDS.

Up 4-0 after their third-inning onslaught, the D-backs got 4⅓ innings with only two hits and no runs allowed from rookie Brandon Pfaadt. The Arizona bullpen mostly kept the Dodgers down from there, with the lone exception being four straight two-out singles that scored two runs in the seventh inning.

Unfortunately for L.A., four singles in an inning aren’t worth as much as four home runs.

Key moment:

It was actually a series of moments in the third inning, as the Diamondbacks became the first team ever to hit four home runs in one inning of postseason play. The first three homers came from Geraldo Perdomo, Ketel Marte and Christian Walker.

Perhaps the most emphatic was the last of the bunch. Gabriel Moreno hit a ball that was initially called a home run, then overturned to a foul ball. No matter. On the very next pitch he saw, Moreno hit another home run — for real this time.

Impact player:

Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. For all the wrong reasons.

Two players who will likely finish in the top four in NL MVP voting contributed nothing on offense for the third straight game. They finished the series a combined 1-for-21, with the lone hit being a Freeman infield single.

The low point came in the eighth inning Wednesday, when Kolten Wong worked a leadoff walk with Betts and then Freeman due up as the potential tying run. Both struck out against D-backs reliever Kevin Ginkel, taking the Dodgers’ last hope of a comeback with them.

No. 1 Atlanta Braves at No. 4 Philadelphia Phillies, Game 3: Phillies 10, Braves 2 (Philadelphia leads 2-1)

Game summary:

What might've seemed like a pitchers’ game in the first two innings quickly turned into a home run derby in the bottom of the third. Nick Castellanos got things started for Philly with a leadoff homer to tie the game 1-1 after the Braves had scored on a Ronald Acuña Jr. double and Ozzie Albies single in the top half of the inning.

Then, after singles from Brandon Marsh and Trea Turner, Bryce Harper proceeded to hit a three-run shot that put Philadelphia ahead 4-1. Two batters later, the Phillies knocked Braves starter Bryce Elder out of the game. Reliever Michael Tonkin inherited Alec Bohm and Bryson Stott and was tasked with getting the final out of the inning. He instead conceded an RBI double to J.T. Realmuto that made it 6-1.

The next two frames passed largely without incident until Harper launched his second home run of the game into center field in the fifth. 7-1 Philadelphia.

Atlanta responded feebly, with an RBI single from Orlando Arcia that cut Philadelphia’s lead to 7-2 in the sixth. But the Phillies got the run back on a Turner home run to center field in the bottom of the inning and then tacked on two more homers from Castellanos and Marsh in the eighth, making it 10-2 and sending the Phillies faithful into pandemonium.

Key moment:

The Phillies’ six-run third inning both gave the team the lead and all but put things out of reach for the Braves. The key blow was the three-run homer from Harper that plated Turner and Marsh.

BRYCE HARPER DEMOLISHED! THAT WAS OBVIOUS! pic.twitter.com/ALs38vPB5V — Talkin’ Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) October 11, 2023

With that swing, Harper changed the tenor of the ballpark – igniting the crowd to maximum volume – and essentially ended Elder’s night, even though manager Brian Snitker left him in for a couple more batters.

Impact player:

The one and only Bryce Harper. A bona fide postseason force, Harper put his stamp on Game 3 early, with the three-run shot that made the game the Phillies’ to lose. He made his presence known again in the fifth, with the towering homer to center, and he came close to a third home run with a deep flyout in the bottom of the sixth.

With the two home runs, Harper set the record for homers in NLDS history, with 10 in his career (passing Braves great Chipper Jones) in just 26 games. Game 3 was the first multihomer postseason game of Harper's career. He also now has the third-most home runs in Phillies playoff history, with nine — in just his second postseason with the team.

"'WAR! It’s something that has made many video games popular over the years, and these games for 2024 might help enforce that in your mind.

#21 Killer Bean

Yes, this game really is called Killer Bean, and yes, you will play as a character known as Killer Bean…what a world we live in.

Don’t let the name fool you, because this title does indeed have depth. Your character was betrayed by those he once trusted, so thus, he seeks revenge by trying to take down the entire shadow organization. But to take them all down is risky and dangerous.

What’s more, every time you play the game…things will be entirely different. The stories, the missions, who you can trust or not, it’ll all be changed so that every single campaign for Killer Bean is different. That sounds like a great way to keep things fresh and fun.

#20 83

The game known as 83 is meant to be an alternate take on history itself. Mainly because the game tries to imagine a time when the Cold War…got very hot. To the extent that massive battles would need to be waged in order to protect the future.

This game is aiming to bring a lot of players to the table, because in each massive map, you’ll be able to hold over 80 players in total, meaning there will be a lot of people running and shooting on the map.

More than that though, you’ll have to work together in order to complete objectives that will change the battlefield and what needs to happen next.

#19 War Hospital

Is there any place more harrowing than a hospital on a battlefield? What about one that doesn’t have the means to save everyone, but they’re asked to do it anyway? In War Hospital, you’ll be in the trenches of World War I and play the role of a battlefield surgeon who is asked to save as many lives as possible. But with the equipment available then, you’ll have to make hard choices that will change people forever.

#18 Roman Empire Wars

Rome is known as one of the greatest Republics/Empires in all of history, so now the question becomes, what would you be if you were the emperor of Rome? You’ll find out in Roman Empire Wars

Because in this game, you’ll well and truly become the emperor of Rome, and with threats on all sides, you’ll need to gather up your legions and bring war to the enemies and then crush them so that they understand that you are the dominant power here.

You’ll get to go to various countries to route the enemy, and must use the various tactics and weapons of the Roman Empire in order to bring victory and glory to your nation and your name.

#17 I.G.I Origins

It’s a bit ironic that we’re getting a sequel in 2024 to a game that came out in 2021. But sometimes, the biggest wars are the ones we never see in the dev room.

I.G.I Origins will put you as the secret agent known as Regent. He’s been recruited by MI6 to take on a group that is threatening the world with war. Your task is to deal with them, but that’s where the twist comes in.

How do you deal with them? It’s entirely up to you. Be a one-man army in the way you desire and unleash fury in a variety of ways. In other words, have fun while you prevent a world crisis.

#16 Headquarters: World War II

World War II has always been a place of focus in the video game world, and now, with Headquarters: World War II, you’ll get yet another take on this war that literally brought the world to war.

In this case, you’ll be in the year 1944, and fight on multiple sides of multiple operations. From the Battle of Normandy to other key legendary fights, you’ll have to make your forces do the right thing in order to achieve victory, or fight back the invaders.

That’s right, you’ll be able to play as three different military powers in the game, and how you command the forces will be vital to your war effort. It’s easy to learn, hard to master, and will be something unique.

#15 Ava: History Untold

History is said to be written by the victors. But it can also be decided by who builds the best stuff and ensures it lasts!

In Ava: History Untold, you’ll create a nation of your own from scratch and then lead it through its various expansive periods so that you can have a nation worthy of your name. How you rule over your lands and its people is up to you, as are the paths you’ll take to build up your technology and skills.

No matter who you are, there will be others in the world, which means that war will come. So be prepared to fight them off.

#14 Ratten Reich

You might be surprised by how many video games choose to go the route of “let’s make an alternate reality where animals are the humans and put them to war.” Ratten Reich is one such game. In the title, you’ll command various animals as they try to unseat the vile rule of the Ratten Reich, which, if not obvious, is a group of animals led by rats. Surprise.

What will surprise you, though, is how deep the customization, units, and combat is. You’ll get to augment your technique based on what you feel is best and take on enemy units in fun ways while also feeling the destruction of your actions.

#13 HeatWave

Now here’s a game that is REALLY different from the others we’ve shown you so far. In HeatWave, you find yourself as part of a guerrilla group that is trying to secure their freedom and reclaim their land.

The twist is that this land…is Alaska. Because in this worlds’ future, global warming has destroyed much (so this is a preview of our own future…) and Alaska has been left to defend itself against an invasion force featuring the Russians and Chinese.

So now, you must command a guerrilla group and ensure that you can take down the opposing forces. You’ll need to be a good leader and know when to strike, when to run, and when to move your base so you can keep up the fight. They’re counting on you, don’t mess it up!

#12 Stormgate

In the future, humanity gets doomed when an alien race comes out of portals and tries to take over the world. They nearly succeed, and almost wipe out humanity as a result.

But, the catch is that humanity did survive, and you fight alongside them to try and reclaim the world by controlling massive mechs and weapons. Or, you can be the bad guys and just wipe out the world! Your choice.

What’s more, you don’t have to play it alone, you can team with up to three friends and try and save the world together. Then go into the editor mode and build your own missions and maps.

#11 MENACE

It was supposed to be a simple mission. You were a marine dispatched to lead a squad to the frontier to bring certain planets back into the control of your civilization. But as you attempt to get the job done, you learn of a dark threat that looms over everything, and the planet you’re on is now the biggest battlefield!

To survive, you’ll unite the other factions and groups within this lawless space under your command, and you’ll use them however you can to overcome challenges and beat this sinister threat.

You won’t have your natural tools and resources to work with here. So, use what is around you and make the deals needed to get the necessary equipment to fight back.

#10 Men of War II

How would you command forces in a war that seemingly has no end in sight? Men of War II will allow you to answer that across multiple modes, all with deep strategies and options for you to employ.

Will you be a tactical commander that uses multiple angles to see the battlefield and then choose the best strategy for your forces? Or will you assemble the best units and tries to use brute strength to save the day?

Whether you play in the campaign, skirmish, or multiplayer modes, you’ll have plenty of time to figure out what works best for you.

#9 Barkhan

You might not think that a planet covered in sand would have much to offer anyone. But buried beneath that sand are materials that could help grow an empire.

As such, three clans have touched down on the world and seek to claim it as their own. Naturally, that means there will be a fight to see who gets it all.

Each clan has their own focus and units that they can use. Pick the one who you feel matches your playstyle and see if you can lead them to victory. Oh, but one thing you should know. The planet has ways of fighting you off, too.

#8 Broken Arrow

What happens when you mix real-time strategy war games with deck-building card games? You get Broken Arrow.

This game will test you in multiple ways, not the least of which is testing how you are able to build a deck full of units and ensure that you use them wisely in battle. Plus, there are two different factions that you’ll be able to take control of via the US and Russia.

With over 200 units in the game combined between the factions, you’ll have a good time trying to make the best deck possible. So test them all out, make the best battle plans possible, then take the fight to the enemy.

#7 Falling Frontier

When it comes to space, there are plenty of reasons for wars to happen. In Falling Frontier, you’ll participate in a conflict within the human race! Humanity has finally reached a new star system, which should be a time for celebration.

However, humanity is fractured, and other colonies have risen up to attempt to claim the star system as your own. As a result, you must build up your fleet, take on these other factions, colonize worlds, and more!

There are many things to do in the game to ensure victory, including expanding your capabilities. So don’t just focus on the war, as there’s more than that going on.

#6 ZEPHON

ZEPHON makes it pretty clear that in this game, humanity isn’t meant to last, it’s pretty much doomed. A war has caused the once bountiful planet of Earth to become a wasteland. One where aliens that tried to attack are now stranded on the Earth and begging for life. Robots wander around with purpose or restraint. As for the humans…well, that’s up to you.

Because it’s up to you to choose the pay that humanity will go on to try and survive the madness. But be warned, your choices will absolutely matter, and you’ll need to make sure you’re supported by people of all skills in order to make things better.

Will you lead humanity back into the light? Or doom them all?

#5 Empire of the Ants

What is this? An empire built for ants?

Jokes aside, Empire of the Ants is based on the hit book series where you’ll become an “ant savior” who must lead his colony to make a new home and dominate the surrounding areas. Yes, you really are playing as ants, and that won’t be as easy as you think.

After all, while you are small, almost everything else around you is big. As such, you’ll need to work with your ant brethren to overcome challenges, build up your defenses and reserves, and take on any threats that come your way.

It’s a beautiful world out there, so don’t forget to explore it before you conquer it.

#4 MECHWARRIOR 5: CLANS

It seems that mech gamers have gotten popular once again, and MECHWARRIOR 5: CLANS will aim to continue that trend in a meaningful way! The game occurs within a 5-person team known as Star, of which you are a member. You’ve been thrown into a war getting more dangerous by the minute as numerous invasions are going on, and your group is attempting to reclaim your home from the fools trying to take it.

Within your mech, you’ll battle across multiple worlds and must immerse yourself in the story to fully understand the magnitude of your role. Do you think you can help your people get back your homeworld?

#3 Manor Lords

Many times, when it comes to medieval war games, your goal is just to build your empire and do battles that you only have some control over. But with Manor Lords, that will change. Because this game goes for a true kind of accuracy in terms of how things were built, and how battles were fought.

For example, while it’s true you will start to build your empire, you’ll do it in a more organic way, and with no grids to “constrain you”.

Then, in the battles, you’ll have large-scale encounters that take things like fatigue, flanking, weather, and positioning into account to ensure a true military battle experience.

So build wisely, battle carefully and see where things take you.

#2 Homeworld 3

Are you ready for a grand-scale RTS that aims to piggyback off of what the last entry did? If so, get ready for Homeworld 3 when it arrives.

The beauty of this game is that you’ll be able to have full-on fleets of ships at your command and use them however you desire. You can even build ships that dwarf everything else out there, so you can say you have the biggest one.

Plus, there’s a story in the game where the galaxy’s fast travel system is starting to fall apart, and you must seek out a legend from the past to save everything.

#1 Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater

Given the grand-scale plot and excellent character moments, some players forget that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is set in the Cold War. It’s a period of great strife, and only Naked Snake can work through a dangerous conspiracy that could plunge the whole world into war.

Slip into some old-school spy-thriller action and learn the true origins of Solid Snake, Foxhound, and more. With the remake, you’ll not only get upgraded visuals to make everything pop on the PS5 but there will be other improvements as well to ensure the game’s quality.

So are you ready, Snake? …Snake? SNAKE!!!!”'",climate,forest fire
"'LAS VEGAS — A'ja Wilson scored 26 points, grabbed 15 rebounds and the Las Vegas Aces routed the New York Liberty 104-76 on Wednesday night to take a 2-0 series lead in the WNBA Finals.

Wilson finished 10 of 16 from the field on her way to recording her 26th double-double this season - including her fourth of the playoffs. She's the third player in WNBA Finals history to have at least 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game.

""We know what's on the line and we had to make sure we came out and took care of home court,"" Wilson said.

The defending champion Aces are now one win away from becoming the first team since the 2001-02 Los Angeles Sparks to repeat as champions.

Game 3 is Sunday in New York. No team has ever rallied from a 0-2 deficit in the WNBA Finals.

Chelsea Gray also had a double-double with 14 points and 11 assists, throwing some beautiful no-look passes for easy baskets. Jackie Young finished with 24 points and Kelsey Plum had 23. It was the second straight game that the guard trio dominated the Liberty.

Jonquel Jones (22), Breanna Stewart (14), Betnijah Laney (12), and Sabrina Ionescu (10) accounted for 76.3% of New York's points, as the Liberty got just 18 points from six others who played.

New York, which lost by 17 in Game 1, came into the game a perfect 9-0 after losses this year. The Aces made sure that streak ended with a dominant first and third quarter. They opened the game scoring 19 of the first 21 points, with 12 points coming from 3-point range. Las Vegas hit seven of its first nine shots - a blistering 77.8% clip - including four 3-pointers.

New York, meanwhile, missed nine of its first 10 attempts.

""It started with our defense,"" Gray said. ""We kept our pressure up, our physicality and we were able to play with our flow offensively.""

The Aces' lead grew as high as 21 points in the opening period before taking a 38-19 lead into the second quarter. Las Vegas set a new record for most points in the first quarter of a WNBA Finals. It was also the most points the Aces scored in any quarter all season.

The Liberty came charging back from a 22-point second-quarter deficit behind a 12-0 run, and outscored the Aces 25-14 in the period to cut Las Vegas' lead to eight, 52-44 at halftime. Jones scored 16 of her points in the second quarter.

New York couldn't carry its momentum into the third, however, as the Aces used a 17-3 run to extend their lead to 69-47. The Aces outscored the Liberty 28-13 in the third quarter, with 20 points coming from Wilson and Young.

The Liberty couldn't close the gap and now will try to avoid getting swept.'",sports,basketball

"'I’ve been a master plumber for over four decades in addition to building and remodeling homes. I was attracted to plumbing because it’s a fascinating three-dimensional puzzle of interconnected drain, waste and vent pipes. Most are invisible behind the walls and ceilings in your home. I also love drawing riser diagrams that show all these pipes. You need one of these to obtain a plumbing permit. Reach out to me if you need me to draw your riser diagram.

Drain pipes of all sizes in your home can clog for many reasons. It’s vital the layout of the pipes have as few changes of direction as possible so the wastewater gets out of your home with minimal friction loss. One hopes your plumber installed the pipes with sufficient slope so the water and solids make it to the city sewer or your septic tank with no issues.

If the pipes are not at fault for clogs, then it’s often human error or oversight that creates a clog. For example, your kitchen drain and even the primary building drain may be clogged with grease. I’ve seen grease clogs that run for 20 feet. The pipe is choked off with a disgusting semi-solid mass that resembles a shortening you might use for baking.

You can prevent grease clogs with just a small amount of effort. Start saving paper towels that you might use to dry your hands or to clean a countertop. Once they are dry, store them in a box under your sink. Use these towels to sop up grease from plates, pans, skillets, bowls and so forth. Toss these grease-soaked towels in the garbage.

After you wash grease-covered items, run hot water in your sink for one minute. Better yet, fill your sink with hot water and then pull out the stopper. This massive amount of hot water fills the entire horizontal branch arm pipe that drains your sink. As the water cascades down the vertical stack, it creates a turbulent whirlpool that rinses any liquid grease off the sides of the pipes. Just as the sink drains out, flush a nearby toilet to try to force all the water into the city sewer or your septic tank.

Bathroom sinks commonly get clogged with hair and cosmetic ingredients. Quite often the clog is located in the short pipe between the bottom of the sink and the p-trap below in the cabinet. The sink stopper and the control rod that makes the stopper go up and down are choke points within the tailpiece pipe just under the sink.

It’s easy to remove the control rod by turning a nut on the tailpiece pipe. Once you have the rod pulled out, you can pull the stopper up. Be prepared to be grossed out. The black biofilm goop needs to be cleaned off the stopper mechanism as well as the inside of the pipe between the sink and the p-trap. Use a long bottle brush that’s just slightly larger in diameter than the drain pipe.

Put a piece of duct tape over the hole where the control rod entered the tailpiece. This will prevent water from entering your cabinet as you run water in the sink while you make the bottle brush go up and down. Check your progress with a flashlight until the drain pipe is nice and clean.

High-quality toilet paper mixed with low-flush toilets is another common source of clogs. Drain pipes in older homes were designed decades ago with the assumption that toilets would send 3.5 gallons of water into the system to transport the waste. Now you have less than 50 percent of that. Remember your high school physics? Force equals mass time acceleration. The water mass has been reduced by half, so the force of the water moving down the pipes has, by default, been reduced as well.

Low-flush toilets, in my opinion, should have never been thrust upon all of us. A vast majority of the country doesn’t have a water shortage. Cities with municipal sewage treatment plants put back into the river the same amount of water each day as is being taken out upstream for drinking water. If you choose to live in a place where it rarely rains, then you can use a low-flush toilet. As for me, I’d give my eye teeth to have my old toilets back.

Should you have a substantial clog in the 4-inch primary building drain in your crawlspace or under a concrete slab, you can often remove the blockage in the pipe. You just need a pipe wrench, a 50- or 100-foot drain-cleaning snake, and a great pair of gloves. There are plenty of videos on YouTube that show you how to use a manual drain-cleaning snake. If you have no luck, then call in the pros who have power drain augers.

If tree roots are causing your clogs, I have several great past columns on my www.AsktheBuilder.com website that show you how to stop the tree roots from entering your pipes. It’s a DIY trick that I’ve used for years that works every time.

"'Our high-pressure system that has dominated our weather is gradually shifting southeastward.

This movement is tightening the pressure gradient over the peninsula, interacting with a stalled frontal boundary in South Florida.

As a result, onshore flow is intensifying, leading to the development of breezy to very windy conditions across East-Central Florida.

Coastal areas can expect sustained winds reaching 25-30 mph, with gusts up to 45 mph. A Wind Advisory takes effect at midnight for all coastal counties, excluding inland parts of Volusia.

These conditions will pose various coastal hazards, including a high risk of life-threatening rip currents and large, rough, breaking waves.

A High Surf Advisory is in effect, along with a Rip Current Statement. Coastal flooding and beach erosion are anticipated as waves reach up to dunes/seawalls during high tide. And we have a Coastal Flood Warning.

Coastal Hazards (Copyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.)

For the rest of the forecast, afternoon highs are expected to peak in the low 70s due to persistent cloud cover.

Onshore flow continues to bring low-level moisture across Florida, resulting in isolated fast-moving showers from the Atlantic waters. These showers become scattered in the afternoon from the Treasure Coast to Lake Okeechobee south.

Heading into Friday, onshore flow persists, with elevated winds at 15-25 mph and gusts up to 30-35 mph near the coastline. A 20-30% chance of showers remains, primarily along the coast, with temperatures reaching widespread low/mid 70s under cloudy skies.

Depending on which direction it takes, we could be talking about a very active Saturday with Heavy Rain of up to 3 to 6 inches...or just windy conditions with maybe an inch of rain.

For now, get ready for High Wind with gusts of 25 to 35 mph across the inland areas, and 35 to 45 on the coast.

Coastal areas should also expect waves of 8 to 12 feet, rip currents, and possible beach erosion. Heavy rain is set for late Saturday into Sunday, and we could have storms approaching severe with the possibility of an isolated tornado.'",climate,flood

"'By DAN GELSTON AP Sports Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Bryce Harper celebrated his 31st birthday with a bang – a 420-foot homer on the first pitch he saw in the National League Championship Series.

That merited a special tribute. As he rounded third base, the Philadelphia Phillies slugger concocted a celebration on the fly: Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate.

“Sometimes I just do stuff, and that felt right,” Harper said. “So I thought I would step on home plate and do that.”

Harper keeps rising to the moment in October, helping the Phillies take another step toward winning their first World Series title since 2008.

The two-time NL MVP launched his 10th postseason homer with Philadelphia, Kyle Schwarber hit his first of this postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-3, in Game 1 of the NLCS on Monday night.

Harper also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs to send the Phillies to their 10th straight home playoff win against NL teams.

“This guy, he is looking for the moment, and he wants it,” Schwarber said. “He’s doing such an unbelievable job for us. Talking about when he is going up to the plate, you are just thinking that he is going to do something special every single time. Can that be unfair to have an expectation on a player? Sure. But that’s what everyone is thinking when you’re in the dugout. Man, what’s this guy going to do next?”

The same could be said about Zack Wheeler after another stellar postseason outing.

Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending NL champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.

José Alvarado got four clutch outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.

Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the playoffs after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.

The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave the crowd a reason to stop cheering – or Arizona a chance to catch its breath until it was too late.

Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen’s first pitch 420 feet into the right field seats. There was some minor consternation that Schwarber – with 47 homers this season and 93 over the last two – had yet to go deep through six playoff games. How easy it was to forget that Schwarber didn’t hit any in the Wild Card Series or NLDS last season before he launched six in the NLCS and World Series. So those Schwarbombs might just be getting started.

“That’s what he does at the start of the game,” Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. “He can put the other team on their heels a little bit and get the lead. And we added on tonight.”

Four pitches later, Harper homered to right-center – the first time in 127 postseason games that Philadelphia went deep twice in the first inning.

“I think they just ambushed him,” Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.

When Castellanos lined his fifth homer of the playoffs in the second – all in the past three games – it gave the Phillies 32 home runs in 13 postseason games at Citizens Bank Park over the last two years.

The Kelce Bros approved. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce – minus celebrity friend Taylor Swift – and Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce went wild. Travis pointed to his brother as Jason pounded a beer in their suite.

Gallen, a South Jersey native, had his name derisively drawn out to “Galll-ennnn” by Phillies fans each time the 17-game winner got into a jam. Too many times, for Arizona.

“That’s an aggressive lineup,” Gallen said. “It’s no secret, they try to get the crowd into it as early as possible and that plays into the aggression. Schwarber and Bryce were just looking for fastballs. They got ’em in locations they could handle.”

Trea Turner hit a one-out double in the third, leaving first base open. Gallen pitched to Harper instead of walking him and got burned by an RBI single for a 4-0 lead.

J.T. Realmuto added an RBI single in the fifth.

Those runs proved crucial for the Phillies. Geraldo Perdomo hit a two-run homer off Wheeler in the sixth that made it 5-2.

Seranthony Domínguez opened the door in the seventh for the Diamondbacks when his throwing error on a comebacker led to an unearned run. Alvarado retired pinch-hitter Emmanuel Rivera on a groundout to keep it 5-3 and tossed a scoreless eighth.

SNAKE EYES

The Diamondbacks, who at 84-78 squeezed into the playoffs as the final NL wild card, were held to four hits. Corbin Carroll and Ketel Marte both went 1 for 4 and Christian Walker and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. were hitless. Gurriel grounded into a game-ending double play.

“There’s a portion of our lineup that was fairly silent that is very capable of carrying this ballclub,” Lovullo said. “With Zac giving up five runs and that part of the lineup, you know, possibly not contributing the way they normally have or can, it tells me a lot about this team that we’re balanced, and we can be dangerous.”

GOING DEEP

Schwarber’s fourth leadoff homer in the postseason moved him past Jimmy Rollins and Derek Jeter for most in baseball history.

Harper joined St. Louis’ Kolten Wong, Tampa Bay’s Evan Longoria and Kansas City’s Willie Aikens as the only players in postseason history to homer on his birthday.

Castellanos’ five homers in his last three postseason games – he hit two in consecutive games against Atlanta – made him the second player to hit those marks. New York Yankees slugger Reggie Jackson did it in the 1977 World Series.

UP NEXT

Arizona sends right-hander Merrill Kelly (1-0 postseason, 0.00 ERA) to the mound Tuesday night in Game 2. Right-hander Aaron Nola (2-0 postseason, 1.42 ERA) will start for the Phillies.

Nola is eligible for free agency after the World Series after he tabled contract extension talks with the team in spring training. Nola made $16 million this year on the club option that was part of the $45 million, four-year deal he signed ahead of the 2019 season. Nola said he wanted to stay in Philadelphia.

“I hope so. I really do,” Nola said before the game. “I love it here. Obviously, it’s the only place I’ve been. I came up through some special times in the rebuilding era ask and getting to witness and be a part of a lot of different type of teams.”

"'In the face of rising global temperatures, cold-loving fish species, including Atlantic salmon and brook trout, face a critical challenge in their quest for survival.

These aquatic creatures require specific temperature ranges to thrive, typically between 43°F and 72°F. Prolonged exposure to water temperatures exceeding 82°F can lead to stress, illness, or even death.

To address this issue, a group of civil engineers from Dalhousie University has engineered a groundbreaking solution: artificial cold-water patches resembling underwater ""air conditioning"" for fish, Interesting Engineering reports.

These innovative thermal refuges are designed to provide respite for fish when confronted with warmer water conditions, offering them a lifeline in the battle against climate-induced river warming.

The engineers presented the results of their groundbreaking experiment during the Geological Society of America's GSA Connects 2023 event, held in October.

The Hunt for Cool-Water Patches

In the natural world, fish in distress due to rising water temperatures often seek out naturally occurring cold-water zones, known as ""thermal refuges.""

These refuges are typically found near groundwater springs, where cold water flows into the river. They are essential for maintaining resilient and diverse aquatic ecosystems capable of withstanding both short-term heatwaves and the potential long-term effects of climate warming.

However, the distribution of these thermal refuges is far from uniform in space, making it challenging for fish to find such vital cool-water sanctuaries.

To address this problem, the team of engineers took on the challenge of constructing engineered thermal patches to help these fish endure elevated temperatures, particularly during the sweltering summer months.

The experiment took place in the warm areas of Wrights River in Nova Scotia, Canada. The team used two distinct approaches to create these artificial cold-water patches: active and passive methods.

Two Innovative Approaches

According to Time, the team used two methods: passive and active.

The Active Approach: In this method, cold water from a well was introduced directly into the river, creating a cold oasis amidst the heated waters. Fish quickly gravitated towards these artificially established cold-water zones, providing a haven from the scorching temperatures.

The Passive Approach: In this method, a branch of the river was rerouted underground for a specific distance. During this journey, the water cooled through contact with the surrounding soil and rocks. When the offshoot rejoined the main river channel, it created an area of water several degrees cooler than the surroundings, enticing fish to seek refuge.

Both approaches proved successful, with the active method attracting more fish, especially during a July heatwave that coincided with the experiment.

The team employed cutting-edge technology, including thermal infrared cameras and water temperature recorders mounted on drones, as well as time-lapse cameras to monitor fish behavior and evaluate the performance of the dynamic thermal refuge system.

These promising results mark a significant step towards protecting cold-water species in the face of climate change-induced river warming. However, more research is necessary to determine the number of artificial cold patches required and how to sustain them efficiently, considering energy expenses and environmental impact.

The two will play in the May 25 Hall of Fame East-West Classic that will honor the Negro Leagues' East-West All-Star Game, which was played from 1933 to 1962. (George Walker IV / Associated Press)

Consider it a way to bring an exhibit to life. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum will celebrate the opening of a new exhibit, ""The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball,"" by putting recently retired Black players in vintage Negro League uniforms and playing nine innings.

The ballgame — and celebration — will take place May 25 at the historic Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, N.Y., and will honor the annual Negro Leagues' East-West All-Star Game, which took place annually from 1933 to 1962.

Big names ought to draw a sizable crowd over the Memorial Day weekend. Ken Griffey Jr. and Ozzie Smith are among the Hall of Famers who will serve as the managers and coaches.

Among the players committed to participate are five former Dodgers: Russell Martin (2006-2010), Tony Gwynn Jr. (2011-2012), Jerry Hairston (2012-2013), Curtis Granderson (2017) and David Price (2021-2022) along with former Angels outfielder Justin Upton.

Others committed to participate include team captains CC Sabathia and Chris Young; Josh Barfield, Tim Beckham, Ian Desmond, Prince Fielder, Dexter Fowler, Scott Hairston, LaTroy Hawkins, Ryan Howard, Edwin Jackson, Jeremy Jeffress, Adam Jones, Tony Sipp, B.J. Upton, and Dontrelle Willis.

The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball will center powerful first-person perspectives of the players and pioneers who lived it.

“The East-West All-Star Game was the annual showcase for the Negro Leagues, and we are privileged to be able to honor the legacy of those stars,” Sabathia said during a news conference held at the MLB Winter Meetings in Nashville. “As players, we are indebted to the pioneers who came before us, and recognizing the All-Stars of the Negro Leagues pays tribute not only to their playing ability but also to their courage and devotion to the game.”

Sabathia capped a decorated 19-year career in 2019 painfully, his left shoulder in shreds with injuries to his rotator cuff, labrum and biceps. He required a full shoulder reconstruction. More than four years later, he has a reason to rehab the shoulder and take the mound one last time in the exhibition.

""When I had the surgery, I told them I’m never going to throw again, so I never did the rehab,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Now I’m going to see if I can get the cutter moving again.”

The Negro Leagues' East-West All-Star Game debuted in 1933 at Chicago’s Comiskey Park and in several years featured multiple games. Several future Hall of Famers starred in the game throughout the years, including Cool Papa Bell, Ray Brown, Andy Cooper, Leon Day, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson and Willie Wells.

Located on the museum’s second floor in the Yawkey Gallery, ""The Souls of the Game: Voices of Black Baseball"" will feature not only stories of early Black baseball, the Negro Leagues' era, the complexities of reintegration and Robinson, but also will document how few Black players break into the big leagues today.

The percentage of Black players peaked through the 1980s at about 18%. In 2023, only about 6% of MLB players were Black. The exhibit is part of the Hall of Fame’s Black Baseball Initiative that includes additional outreach programs, educational materials and virtual programming.

"'MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - Alabama had yet another dry week, which has caused drought conditions to worsen and expand. A small part of northeastern Alabama has actually been upgraded “exceptional drought,” which is the worst category on the scale.

Dry weather has been plaguing the state for the last few months now. Montgomery finished October below normal in the rain department, making it three straight months of drier-than-normal weather.

Montgomery is running about an inch below normal in the rain department in 2023. (WSFA 12 News)

The Drought Monitor is updated each Thursday at 7:30 a.m. This week’s update has almost every square inch -- 98.52% to be exact -- of the state in some sort of drought, ranging from moderate (D1) to exceptional (D4).

More than three-fourths of the state -- 78.57% -- is in a severe (D2), extreme (D3) or exceptional (D4) drought. Just under 38% of the state is experiencing either extreme or exceptional drought, the two highest categories on the drought scale.

Only a small part of Lee County is free of drought conditions in this week’s update.

The drought has worsened and expanded again in Alabama. (WSFA 12 News)

The ongoing drought has really drained our ground of moisture. As a result, grass is browning and lawns are turning crunchy, trees are shedding leaves prematurely, and some crop issues are arising.

It’s vital to avoid outdoor burning until further notice. It’s also important to remember other means that can start fires...

Make sure no chains are dragging on the ground while towing, watch out for dry grass and leaves when parking because starting your vehicle near dry vegetation can actually cause a spark, and avoid throwing cigarette butts outside.

The last time Alabama had a drought as significant and widespread as this was back in the fall of 2016. Nearly the entire state was in either an extreme or exceptional drought at some point that fall.

Total rain between Friday and Sunday will be up around or even just over 1 inch in Central Alabama. (WSFA 12 News)

Fortunately we do have rain on the way soon! Periods of light rain will move through over the next several days, delivering much-needed water to the state. It won’t end the drought as it takes more than a few days of light rain to do that.

It will, though, help us out. Most forecast models suggest a little over an inch of rain by the end of the day Sunday in Central Alabama. Some towns will see close to an inch and half while others may only see about a half-inch of rain.

Even better news is additional rain is very much possible as next week progresses. Details are a bit muddled regarding that part of the forecast, so I urge you to continue checking back!

"'The effects of a rapidly warming climate are being felt in every corner of the US and will worsen over the next 10 years with continued fossil fuel use , according to a stark new report from federal agencies.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated report due roughly every five years, warned that even though planet-warming pollution in the US is slowly decreasing, it is not happening nearly fast enough to meet the nation’s targets, nor is it in line with the UN-sanctioned goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius – a threshold beyond which scientists warn life on Earth will struggle to cope.

This year’s assessment reflects the reality that Americans can increasingly see and feel climate impacts in their own communities, said Katharine Hayhoe, a distinguished climate scientist at Texas Tech University and contributor to the report.

“Climate change is affecting every aspect of our lives,” Hayhoe told CNN.

Some of the report’s sweeping conclusions remain painfully familiar: No part of the US is truly safe from climate disasters; slashing fossil fuel use is critical to limit the consequences, but we’re not doing it fast enough; and every fraction of a degree of warming leads to more intense impacts.

But there are some important new additions: Scientists can now say with more confidence when the climate crisis has made rainstorms, hurricanes and wildfires stronger or more frequent, long-term drought more severe and heat more deadly.

The remains of a vehicle in a burned neighborhood after wildfires in Lahaina in Maui, Hawaii, on August 18. - Bryan Anselm/New Jersey State Council for the Arts Fellowship/Redux

This summer alone, the Phoenix area baked through a record 31 consecutive days above 110 degrees, a shocking heatwave that was partly responsible for more than 500 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County in 2023 – its deadliest year for heat on record.

In July, a torrential rainstorm deluged parts of Vermont in deadly floodwaters. Then in August, Maui was devastated by a fast-moving wildfire and Florida’s Gulf Coast was slammed by its second major hurricane in two years.

President Joe Biden will deliver remarks on Tuesday and is expected to unveil more than $6 billion in funding to strengthen climate resilience “by bolstering America’s electric grid, investing in water infrastructure upgrades, reducing flood risk to communities, and advancing environmental justice for all,” an administration official said.

The US needs “a transformation of the global economy on a size and scale that’s never occurred in human history” to “create a livable future for ourselves and our children,” White House senior climate adviser John Podesta told reporters.

Here are five significant takeaways from the federal government’s sweeping climate report.

It’s easier to pinpoint which disasters were made worse by climate change

The latest report contains an important advancement in what’s called “attribution science” – scientists can more definitively show how climate change is affecting extreme events, like heatwaves, droughts to hurricanes and severe rainstorms.

Climate change doesn’t cause things like hurricanes or wildfires, but it can make them more intense or more frequent.

For instance, warmer oceans and air temperatures mean hurricanes are getting stronger faster and dumping more rainfall when they slam ashore. And hotter and drier conditions from climate change can help vegetation and trees become tinderboxes, turning wildfires into megafires that spin out of control.

“Now thanks to the field of attribution, we can make specific statements,” Hayhoe said, saying attribution can help pinpoint certain areas of a city that are now more likely to flood due to the effects of climate change. “The field of attribution has advanced significantly over the last five years, and that really helps people connect the dots.”

All regions are feeling climate change, but some more severely

There is no place immune from climate change, Biden administration officials and the report’s scientists emphasized, and this summer’s extreme weather was a deadly reminder.

Some states – including California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas – are facing more significant storms and extreme swings in precipitation.

Landlocked states won’t have to adapt to sea level rise, though some – including Appalachian states like Kentucky and West Virginia – have seen devastating flooding from rainstorms.

And states in the north are grappling with an increase in tick-borne diseases, less snow, and stronger rainstorms.

“There is no place that is not at risk, but there are some that are more or less at risk,” Hayhoe told CNN. “That is a factor of both the increasingly frequent and severe weather and climate extremes you’re exposed to, as well as how prepared (cities and states) are.”

Climate change is exacting a massive economic toll

Climate shocks on the economy are happening more frequently, the report said, evidenced by the new record this year for the number of extreme weather disasters costing at least $1 billion. And disaster experts have spent the last year warning the US is only beginning to see the economic fallout of the climate crisis.

Climate risks are hitting the housing market in the form of skyrocketing homeowners’ insurance rates. Some insurers have pulled out of high-risk states altogether.

Stronger storms wiping out certain crops or extreme heat killing livestock can send food prices soaring. And in the Southwest, the report’s researchers found that hotter temperatures in the future could lead to a 25% loss of physical work capacity for agricultural workers from July to September.

The US is cutting planet-warming pollution, but not nearly fast enough

Unlike the world’s other top polluters – China and India – planet-warming pollution in the US is declining. But it’s not happening nearly fast enough to stabilize the planet’s warming or meet the United States’ international climate commitments, the report explains.

The country’s annual greenhouse gas emissions fell 12% between 2005 and 2019, driven in large part by the electricity sector moving away from coal and toward renewable energy and methane gas, the latter of which is still a fossil fuel that has a significant global warming effect.

The decline is good news for the climate crisis, but look at the fine print and the picture is mixed.

The report finds US planet-warming emissions “remain substantial” and would have to sharply decline by 6% annually on average to be in line with the international 1.5-degree goal. To put that cut into perspective, US emissions decreased by less than 1% per year between 2005 and 2019 – a tiny annual drop.

Water – too much and not enough – is a huge problem for the US

One of the report’s biggest takeaways centers on the precarious future of water in the US, and how parts of the country are facing a future with either extreme drought and water insecurity, or more flooding and sea level rise.

Drought and less snowpack are huge threats to Southwest communities in particular. The report’s Southwest chapter, led by Arizona State University climate scientist Dave White, found the region was significantly drier from 1991 to 2020 than the three decades before.

White said that’s an ominous sign as the planet continues to warm, with significant threats to snowpack in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains and the Rockies – both of which provide crucial freshwater in the West.

White added that a lack of freshwater in the region also has significant economic and agricultural impacts, as it supports cities, farms, and Native American tribes.

“Mountains are our natural reservoirs in the region,” White told CNN. “Climate impacts on that mountain snowpack have really significant negative effects for the way our infrastructure operates. It’s just critical for us to protect those resources.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia is bracing for an intense heatwave across its north and west during the New Year's holiday weekend with temperatures forecast to touch more than 45 degrees Celsius (113°F), while severe thunderstorms were expected to hit the country's east.

The heatwave follows a wild weather system that battered the country's east over the Christmas holidays killing 10 people and knocking down power for tens of thousands, and after Cyclone Jasper earlier this month caused widespread flooding and damage.

Australia's December-February summer is under the influence of the El Nino phenomenon, which usually brings above-average daytime temperatures, and can cause weather extremes ranging from wildfires to tropical cyclones and prolonged droughts.

Extreme heatwave conditions are forecast for large swathes of the state of Western Australia, with temperatures in Marble Bar, a remote old mining town in the northwest, expected to hit 49°C (120.2°F) on Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest update.

Queensland outback towns of Longreach and Julia Creek in the northeast are set to hit 47°C this weekend, while nighttime temperatures in many parts of the Northern Territory could remain in the low 30s for several days.

The intense heatwave has also prompted authorities to raise bushfire risks with several regions under total fire bans.

But in the east, thunderstorms are expected to redevelop from Friday across eastern Queensland and northeast New South Wales, continuing into the new year.

""Severe thunderstorms are possible ... although activity will not be as widespread compared to previous days. Isolated gusty thunderstorms are also possible over western South Australia,"" said Sarah Scully, forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology.

Some storms in the east could become severe on Friday afternoon, with the potential for large hail, wind gusts of more than 90 kmh (56 mph) and heavy rain.

The storms were expected to ease by New Year's Eve and not impact Sydney's iconic fireworks display as the Bureau of Meteorology predicted cloudy conditions on Sunday with a very slight chance of rain.

"'Israel should not be allowed to do to Gaza what it has long been doing to the West Bank.

After a brief hiatus of seven days in late November, Israel has resumed its punishing campaign of indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. This time, the majority of the strikes are hitting the South of the besieged Strip, where about 1.8 million Palestinians are currently trapped, many of whom were forced to move from the North following Israeli evacuation orders.

As if from the depths of an Orwellian dystopia, Israel’s war cabinet, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has created a map dividing Gaza into 620 separate plots, supposedly to be used by Palestinian civilians to avoid getting caught in “active war zones”.

Netanyahu has also designated, with complete disregard for international law, a plot of land smaller than London’s Heathrow Airport as a “humanitarian area” and suggested Gaza’s entire population of 2.3 million should eventually go there.

What does this tell us about Netanyahu’s plans for the day after the war?

The Egyptian authorities have publicly stated their fear that the aim of Netanyahu’s war is not to “eradicate Hamas” but to make Gaza uninhabitable so that the Palestinians living there are forced to abandon their homes and leave for good – a second Nakba in the making.

However, I believe Netanyahu’s actual plan for post-war Gaza is different but equally sinister – he is gearing up to repeat a historical crime his country committed against the Palestinian people, but that crime is not necessarily the Nakba.

After severing the link between Gaza and the West Bank, over the years Israel gradually divided the West Bank into smaller, disconnected plots. This made it much easier for Israel to continue stealing Palestinian territory with impunity. (In fact, since October 7, with the global community’s attention firmly fixated on Gaza, Israel has sped up the expansion of its illegal settlement project in the West Bank, and began to openly arm fanatic settlers.)

If Netanyahu has his way, what has happened to the West Bank will also happen to Gaza. Initially, the Strip will be split into three or more smaller entities with Israeli controlled “buffer zones” in between. Then the settlers will come in and start claiming more and more territory, leaving Palestinians divided and stuck in tiny, walled-in enclaves with no hope for the future.

Of course, as he moves to mutilate Gaza in the same way Israel mutilated the West Bank over the past few decades, Netanyahu appears to be ignoring a crucial factor: the Palestinian will to survive and resist. This time, they will be fighting an existential fight, on the rubble of their destroyed homes and the graves of their killed kin, with nothing left to lose. They will not accept their fate quietly.

An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is in the making. Israel’s collective punishment of the besieged population of Gaza has already killed more than 18,200 people, including at least 7,700 children. Israel’s apparent plans to carve Gaza into pieces will only bring on more suffering, and violence.

What should the international community do to put a stop to this disaster?

One can only hope that the world will not remain a passive spectator to this unprecedented, unlawful and egregious attack on an oppressed population for much longer and will eventually be galvanised into action to stop this horrendous onslaught.

The United States and its Western partners, who are allowing and aiding Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza while disingenuously calling for a two-state solution, cannot be trusted to resolve this crisis and ensure the safety and dignity of the Palestinian people. Despite overwhelming support for the humanitarian ceasefire proposal at the UN Security Council – following the unprecedented invoking of Article 99 by Antonio Guterres – the US vetoed it. A few days later, the US found itself further isolated, voting, along with just nine other nations, against a similar UN General Assembly resolution.

Accepting to focus on the mere provision of the most urgent humanitarian relief, such as food, water and medical aid, to Gaza while allowing Israel to continue with its devastating assault on the enclave will achieve little other than giving Netanyahu’s plans for Palestine another international seal of approval.

Furthermore, if Israel does not stop the bombs and the tanks, and agrees to lift the siege soon, no amount of humanitarian aid could save the Palestinians in Gaza. As Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, has recently warned, if it is not stopped soon, Israel’s war on Gaza, combined with its relentless siege, will unleash a humanitarian “tsunami” of catastrophic proportions, with not only bombs and bullets but also a variety of communicable diseases killing starving and fatigued civilians in their thousands.

Rather than entrusting the fate of Palestinians to Israel – and its Western benefactors – as has been the case since Oslo, the international community, led by the global majority, should take matters into its own hands and engineer a just solution involving important regional and global players.

The only way to provide a sustainable solution to this deep-rooted conflict is to acknowledge that it does not involve two actors on equal footing, but is rather between an occupying force (Israel) and an occupied population (the Palestinian people, both in Gaza and the West Bank). Any solution constructed and supported by the international community should also address the grievances of the millions of Palestinian refugees whose families have been in limbo since their forcible eviction from their homeland during the Nakba.

A piecemeal and superficial approach, either ignoring the true nature of and the primary grievances underpinning this conflict, or attempting to address just one sub-section of it (for example, providing a road map for Gaza alone), would be akin to responding to a raging forest fire by extinguishing the flames on the tree closest to us and calling it a day.

Any post-war arrangements should pave the way for the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. This means the proposed arrangement should allow Palestinians to live in peace and security with dignity, have opportunities to study and travel freely, and enjoy the same rights as the rest of the global community.

The experience from Kosovo’s transition under the guidance of the UN in the aftermath of the 1998-99 Kosovo war could provide a tried and tested template. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which led Kosovar resistance against Serbia, despite being classified as a terrorist organisation by the US and others until 1998, was allowed after the end of the war to play a leading role in the political process that ultimately led to the creation of independent Kosovo.

Just like the KLA, Hamas is an armed resistance movement whose military ambitions exist only as far as the occupation exists and will cease the day Palestinians achieve their rights and can live with dignity and freedom.

Finally, if the rules-based world order has any hopes of surviving in the aftermath of Israel’s Western-sanctioned genocide in Gaza, the perpetrators of this crime against humanity cannot be allowed to walk away scot-free. The cost of reconstruction must be borne by Israel. It would be an injustice for those countries who have financed the reconstruction of Gaza following past wars to have to foot the bill once again. Furthermore, if the global community is serious about achieving sustainable peace in Palestine, and finally putting an end to decades of bloodshed, it should stop Israel from expanding its illegal settlement enterprise into Gaza, and start taking meaningful steps to ensure the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state – now.

In the 124th all-time meeting between the Army Black Knights and the Navy Midshipmen, Army was able to build a first-half lead and never relinquished it, winning the game 17-11 despite a late charge from Navy.

The game took place at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts, and saw the Black Knights improve to 6-6 on the season. The victory also secured the Commander-in-Chief trophy for Army, as the team defeated both Navy and Air Force during the 2023 season.

The first quarter was scoreless, although a huge interception from Army's Max DiDomenico provided the game's first big momentum shift.

This would lead to a scoring drive for the Black Knights that was capped off with a passing touchdown from quarterback Bryson Daily to running back Tyson Riley.

The Black Knights would add a field goal at the end of the opening half to increase the lead to 10-0. Neither team would break through in the third quarter, but the Midshipmen finally got on the board early in the third quarter with a field goal that made the score 10-3.

Navy would have a chance to tie the game at 10 but Army linebacker Kalib Fortner would force a fumble and took it 44 yards for a touchdown to increase the lead to 17-3.

Navy would make a push after this, scoring a touchdown and advancing all the way to the one-yard line as time expired, but came up just short and finished its season with a 5-7 record.

The victory secured the Black Knight's 10th overall Commander-in-Chief trophy, fourth in the 21st century and first since 2020. Fans on social media celebrated Army's accomplishment.'",sports,football
"'Former Portland Trail Blazers assistant coach Nate Tibbetts is finalizing a deal which would make him the head coach of the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.

ESPN Sources: Orlando Magic assistant Nate Tibbetts is finalizing a deal to become the new head coach of the Phoenix Mercury. Tibbetts — who’s also been an assistant with Portland and Cleveland — will become the highest paid coach in WNBA history.

His contract, which has yet to see the full details announced, is set to make Tibbetts the highest paid coach in WNBA history.

The hiring comes after the Mercury fired their previous head coach, Vanessa Nygaard, after a 2-10 start to the season. Nikki Blue served as the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.

Tibbetts began his coaching career as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 2011-12 season before joining Portland as an assistant before the 2013-14 season.

"'One of Tom Brady's former New England Patriots teammates is calling on the franchise to sign the retired seven-time Super Bowl champion amid its quarterback woes.

Former Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel Sr. once again praised Brady while throwing shade at his former head coach, Bill Belichick, after New England's 38-0 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday (October 8), which dropped the team to 1-4 through its first five games.

""This terrible team that everybody sees is a terrible team. He can come right now, today, and win a Super Bowl for the New England Patriots. Because that's Tom Brady,"" Samuel told TMZ Sports on Monday (October 9).

""I compare this team to the 2015 Super Bowl champions,"" Samuel added. ""I see the same exact team -- it's only minus Tom Brady is the difference. And I can see Tom coming and leading this to the Super Bowl.""

Starting quarterback Mac Jones was benched for backup Bailey Zappe for late in the Patriots' blowout loss for the second consecutive week. Jones, a former first-round draft pick, threw for 110 yards and two interceptions on 12 of 22 passing on Sunday.

Samuel, who played alongside Brady and under Belichick in New England during his first five NFL seasons (2003-07), has publicly denounced his former coach numerous times since Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.

""I don't understand why is it such a big drop off when one man leaves the 53-man roster -- why is it such a big dropoff and you can't replace it but you're supposed to be a great coach?"" Samuel told TMZ Sports.

"'The recent European Court of Justice ruling on the European Super League (ESL) has reignited discussions about the financial and structural future of European football. This ruling, which deemed the actions of FIFA and UEFA in blocking the ESL as unlawful, raises critical questions about the financial implications for the sport’s governing bodies, clubs, and the broader football ecosystem.

Initially, the ESL was conceived as a ‘breakaway’ league by 12 major European clubs, including six from the Premier League. This move was met with substantial opposition from fans, UEFA, FIFA, and national associations, leading to a swift withdrawal of most clubs from the project. However, key participants Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Juventus persisted, taking the matter to court. The Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice ruled that FIFA and UEFA had contravened EU law by preventing the formation of the Super League, abusing their dominant position in the football world.

The court’s verdict means European clubs can potentially join other continental leagues without facing sanctions from UEFA or FIFA. This decision introduces a new dynamic into the footballing landscape, potentially enabling clubs to explore alternative competitions and revenue streams. For instance, A22, the sports agency backing ESL, proposed new competitions involving 64 men’s and 32 women’s teams, a move that could significantly alter the structure of European football.

Financially, this ruling could have substantial implications. The ESL project, as initially proposed, was expected to generate substantial revenues for the participating clubs, largely through broadcasting rights and sponsorships. This revenue potential was one of the key attractions for the clubs, promising greater financial stability and independence from the existing UEFA-controlled competitions like the Champions League.

However, opponents of the breakaway league cite UEFA and FIFA as long-term stewards of the sport’s major competitions, and their governance includes mechanisms for redistributing income across the wider football pyramid. The creation of a Super League could potentially disrupt this balance, leading to greater financial disparities between the elite clubs and the rest of the football community.

Moreover, the reaction of fans, players, and the general public to the initial Super League announcement was overwhelmingly negative. This was due to the closed nature of the competition, which would have eliminated promotion and relegation processes, impacting and potentially eroding fair-play in favor of sustained profits for the clubs allowed into the competition based on contentious criteria.

The recent ruling raises questions, however, about the legal and regulatory framework governing sports competitions in Europe. It challenges the long-standing dominance of UEFA and FIFA in organizing and profiting from major football competitions and could lead to a more open market for sports competitions in the EU and abroad.

"'COATESVILLE — For the city, residents remember vividly the devastating floodwaters brought by Tropical Storm Ida on the eve of September in 2021.

In America between 1980 to this past August, natural disasters have cost approximately $2.6 trillion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hurricane Ida caused an estimated $75 billion in damages and 96 deaths.

This past summer, Brandywine Conservancy announced a new partnership with the Chester County Water Resources Authority and the University of Delaware Water Resources Center to conduct a flood study to better understand where and why flooding occurs while identifying best practices to safeguard locals who live here from the severe flooding disasters in the future.

“As Hurricane Ida, and many prior floods have taught us, there is an urgent need for the Brandywine Flood Study so that we can identify ways to mitigate the impact of severe flooding events along the Brandywine Creek in both Pennsylvania and Delaware,” said Grant DeCosta, director of community services for the Brandywine Conservancy in in Chadds Ford, Delaware County.

The storm reaches Pennsylvania on September 1 as an extratropical cyclone. Within the next 24 hours, Ida causes catastrophic river and flash flooding with floodwaters swiftly taking over the courtyard at the Brandywine Museum of Art in Chadds Ford. (COURTESY OF BRANDYWINE CONSERVANCY)

The conservancy’s headquarters span 15 acres in both Delaware and Chester counties, along the Brandywine Creek. The location is also home to the Brandywine Museum of Art, which was severely flooded during Ida, although no rare paintings were lost during the historic event.

“Once the flood study is completed, the Brandywine Conservancy and its partners are committed to working with impacted communities, elected officials, key funders and government agencies to implement the study’s recommendations so that the watershed and its residents in both states are better prepared, protected and equipped to rebound from future severe flooding events,” DeCosta said.

Encompassing the mainstem of the Brandywine Creek and key tributaries in Chester and Delaware Counties in Pennsylvania and traveling downstream to impacted areas over the Delaware state line, the flood study aims to identify options for reducing flood impacts to improve public safety and lessen property damage, according to officials who delivered remarks during a press conference at the Brandywine Museum of Art in late August. The study will be funded, in part, through grants from Chester County Government and Delaware County Council.

‘Ground zero’

In July, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded Coatesville $621,360 in Flood Mitigation Assistance grant money to design and engineer long-term resilience solutions to reduce the potential for flooding within the municipality; the only city in Chester County.

“The grant will be utilized to address inefficiencies in our stormwater management network,” said City Manager James Logan, “which includes outdated pipes, inability to manage high volumes of water, and water flow challenges caused by the Brandywine River.”

Coatesville is built in a valley, and when the remnants of Hurricane Ida hit the city as a tropical storm, the overpowering rainfall swiftly toppled not only the nearby streams uphill, bringing floodwaters down to Olive Street along Fifth Avenue and elsewhere.

At Fifth and Sixth avenues and Olive Street, the floodwaters reached as high as stop octagons and street signs — up to 10 feet, as previously reported.

Linda Lavender-Norris, Coatesville City Council president, described the area as “ground zero.”

The infrastructure has yet to be replaced. Pennsylvania will receive $1.6 billion for bridge improvements, including for off-system bridges, from the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, as previously reported. Additional money earmarked for Pennsylvania for infrastructure investments includes$11.3 billion for the federal highway program; $2.8 billion for public transportation; $1.4 billion for water infrastructure.

Located 39 miles west of Philadelphia and founded in 1915, Coatesville is home to 13,300 residents. When the dust settled after Ida two years ago, 130 homeowners and renters were left without a place to live.

After Ida, Cedarville Engineering Group recently evaluated the city’s stormwater mitigation system and infrastructure and determined Gibbons Run Culvert, which runs under Ash Park and west to the Brandywine, as a significant choke point, according to city officials. The culvert was overwhelmed by runoff and unable to transport enough stormwater from the area to reduce or prevent flooding.

“With this grant, we will be looking at developing a solution which will help build resiliency into the city’s infrastructure to help with similar events in the future,” said Kyle Turner of Cedarville.

While the existing infrastructure performed as expected, it could not accommodate the sheer volume of water and rise of the Brandywine, he said.

Chester County Commissioners approved a Declaration of Disaster Emergency during Ida and the county’s 911 Communication Center processed more than 4,000 calls, resulting in more than 300 storm-related rescues in a 10-hour time frame during Tropical Storm Ida. In Downingtown, there was one death because of the storm’s flooding.

Pennsylvania, home to more than 25,400 state-owned bridges, features 83,184 miles of streams and rivers, more than 4,000 lakes, reservoirs, and ponds, and 120 miles of coastal waters, as previously reported.

Only one state in America has more water than Pennsylvania: Alaska.

United partners

Led by the Brandywine Conservancy, Chester County and University of Delaware joint-study will evaluate the Brandywine Creek’s flow regimes during intense storm events, along with the scale and potential impact of subsequent flooding. Stroud Water Research Center, West Chester University and other technical experts as key partners will also take part.

“On behalf of Chester County, the Water Resources Authority is proud to be a partner in this watershed-based approach to identify a range of solutions that address flood impacts in our communities,” said Seung Ah Byun, executive director of the Chester County Water Resources Authority, on August 22.

“We also view this as a way to build resiliency and mitigate the potential effects from future storm events that may be larger and more intense due to our changing climate,” she said. “Approaching this from a more regional scale is important, because what our upstream communities do affects our neighbors downstream.”

Following the data gathering and field study phase, the partners will begin site assessment for improvements to the flood study area to mitigate future flooding. The recommended solutions will be evaluated for various factors, including impact and cost, in order to facilitate strategic implementation throughout the study area.

During Ida, the Brandywine Creek at Chadds Ford crested at over 21 feet — nearly four feet higher than the previous highest recording, as previously reported.

“We are thrilled to support the Brandywine Flood Study, led by the Brandywine Conservancy in partnership with the Chester County Water Resources Authority and the University of Delaware Water Resources Center,” said Monica Taylor of the Delaware County Council. “This coordinated effort will be key to helping us better protect our communities from future severe floods and will help us more fully understand and respond to all of the contributing factors that lead to extreme flooding along the Brandywine Creek.”

The Brandywine Conservancy expects that the flood study will be completed by June 2024.

One of the first tasks of the flood study will involve refining the study area to determine all the streams and tributaries with flow regimes that contribute to major flood events, according to

Nicole Kindbeiter, director of marketing and communications at the Brandywine Conservancy.

“The study partners will then evaluate the designated area’s storm event and climate data, population, land use, water quality, natural areas and cultural resources. Historical and present flooding data will also be evaluated, and then the partners will develop hydrologic and hydraulic models of the Brandywine Creek using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Hydrologic Engineer Center’s River Analysis System,” Kindbeiter said.

Then, “using these models, the partners will identify problems associated with the geography and hydrology of the flood study area. This process will also include public workshops and field reconnaissance of the defined study area,” she said.

“In 2021, Hurricane Ida sideswiped our area and caused the biggest flood in 200 years along the historic Brandywine Creek,” said Gerald Kauffman Jr., director of the University of Delaware Water Resources Center.

“We look forward to working with our upstream partners in this bi-state and intergovernmental Brandywine Flood Study to identify the root causes of the flooding, as well as recommend and hopefully implement real flood solutions for the people who live and work in the watershed in Delaware and Pennsylvania.”'",climate,flood
"'Israel should not be allowed to do to Gaza what it has long been doing to the West Bank.

After a brief hiatus of seven days in late November, Israel has resumed its punishing campaign of indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. This time, the majority of the strikes are hitting the South of the besieged Strip, where about 1.8 million Palestinians are currently trapped, many of whom were forced to move from the North following Israeli evacuation orders.

As if from the depths of an Orwellian dystopia, Israel’s war cabinet, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has created a map dividing Gaza into 620 separate plots, supposedly to be used by Palestinian civilians to avoid getting caught in “active war zones”.

Netanyahu has also designated, with complete disregard for international law, a plot of land smaller than London’s Heathrow Airport as a “humanitarian area” and suggested Gaza’s entire population of 2.3 million should eventually go there.

What does this tell us about Netanyahu’s plans for the day after the war?

The Egyptian authorities have publicly stated their fear that the aim of Netanyahu’s war is not to “eradicate Hamas” but to make Gaza uninhabitable so that the Palestinians living there are forced to abandon their homes and leave for good – a second Nakba in the making.

However, I believe Netanyahu’s actual plan for post-war Gaza is different but equally sinister – he is gearing up to repeat a historical crime his country committed against the Palestinian people, but that crime is not necessarily the Nakba.

After severing the link between Gaza and the West Bank, over the years Israel gradually divided the West Bank into smaller, disconnected plots. This made it much easier for Israel to continue stealing Palestinian territory with impunity. (In fact, since October 7, with the global community’s attention firmly fixated on Gaza, Israel has sped up the expansion of its illegal settlement project in the West Bank, and began to openly arm fanatic settlers.)

If Netanyahu has his way, what has happened to the West Bank will also happen to Gaza. Initially, the Strip will be split into three or more smaller entities with Israeli controlled “buffer zones” in between. Then the settlers will come in and start claiming more and more territory, leaving Palestinians divided and stuck in tiny, walled-in enclaves with no hope for the future.

Of course, as he moves to mutilate Gaza in the same way Israel mutilated the West Bank over the past few decades, Netanyahu appears to be ignoring a crucial factor: the Palestinian will to survive and resist. This time, they will be fighting an existential fight, on the rubble of their destroyed homes and the graves of their killed kin, with nothing left to lose. They will not accept their fate quietly.

An unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe is in the making. Israel’s collective punishment of the besieged population of Gaza has already killed more than 18,200 people, including at least 7,700 children. Israel’s apparent plans to carve Gaza into pieces will only bring on more suffering, and violence.

What should the international community do to put a stop to this disaster?

One can only hope that the world will not remain a passive spectator to this unprecedented, unlawful and egregious attack on an oppressed population for much longer and will eventually be galvanised into action to stop this horrendous onslaught.

The United States and its Western partners, who are allowing and aiding Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza while disingenuously calling for a two-state solution, cannot be trusted to resolve this crisis and ensure the safety and dignity of the Palestinian people. Despite overwhelming support for the humanitarian ceasefire proposal at the UN Security Council – following the unprecedented invoking of Article 99 by Antonio Guterres – the US vetoed it. A few days later, the US found itself further isolated, voting, along with just nine other nations, against a similar UN General Assembly resolution.

Accepting to focus on the mere provision of the most urgent humanitarian relief, such as food, water and medical aid, to Gaza while allowing Israel to continue with its devastating assault on the enclave will achieve little other than giving Netanyahu’s plans for Palestine another international seal of approval.

Furthermore, if Israel does not stop the bombs and the tanks, and agrees to lift the siege soon, no amount of humanitarian aid could save the Palestinians in Gaza. As Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, has recently warned, if it is not stopped soon, Israel’s war on Gaza, combined with its relentless siege, will unleash a humanitarian “tsunami” of catastrophic proportions, with not only bombs and bullets but also a variety of communicable diseases killing starving and fatigued civilians in their thousands.

Rather than entrusting the fate of Palestinians to Israel – and its Western benefactors – as has been the case since Oslo, the international community, led by the global majority, should take matters into its own hands and engineer a just solution involving important regional and global players.

The only way to provide a sustainable solution to this deep-rooted conflict is to acknowledge that it does not involve two actors on equal footing, but is rather between an occupying force (Israel) and an occupied population (the Palestinian people, both in Gaza and the West Bank). Any solution constructed and supported by the international community should also address the grievances of the millions of Palestinian refugees whose families have been in limbo since their forcible eviction from their homeland during the Nakba.

A piecemeal and superficial approach, either ignoring the true nature of and the primary grievances underpinning this conflict, or attempting to address just one sub-section of it (for example, providing a road map for Gaza alone), would be akin to responding to a raging forest fire by extinguishing the flames on the tree closest to us and calling it a day.

Any post-war arrangements should pave the way for the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state. This means the proposed arrangement should allow Palestinians to live in peace and security with dignity, have opportunities to study and travel freely, and enjoy the same rights as the rest of the global community.

The experience from Kosovo’s transition under the guidance of the UN in the aftermath of the 1998-99 Kosovo war could provide a tried and tested template. The Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which led Kosovar resistance against Serbia, despite being classified as a terrorist organisation by the US and others until 1998, was allowed after the end of the war to play a leading role in the political process that ultimately led to the creation of independent Kosovo.

Just like the KLA, Hamas is an armed resistance movement whose military ambitions exist only as far as the occupation exists and will cease the day Palestinians achieve their rights and can live with dignity and freedom.

Finally, if the rules-based world order has any hopes of surviving in the aftermath of Israel’s Western-sanctioned genocide in Gaza, the perpetrators of this crime against humanity cannot be allowed to walk away scot-free. The cost of reconstruction must be borne by Israel. It would be an injustice for those countries who have financed the reconstruction of Gaza following past wars to have to foot the bill once again. Furthermore, if the global community is serious about achieving sustainable peace in Palestine, and finally putting an end to decades of bloodshed, it should stop Israel from expanding its illegal settlement enterprise into Gaza, and start taking meaningful steps to ensure the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state – now.

"'The commission suggests ideas on what’s needed in the facility

The Parks and Recreation Commission met on Oct. 17 to receive an update on the Malibu Bluffs Snack Shack.

Community Service Director Kristen Riesgo presented a few examples of refabricated facilities and asked the commission for recommendations.

The Malibu Little League community has been excited about the Snack Shack since the Malibu City Council approved the project earlier this year. Parks and Recreation members and young members of the public spoke, advocating for the Snack Shack and its importance to the community.

The Malibu Little League Parade also returned on Closing Day on June 3, where hundreds of families, friends, and even council members joined to celebrate the children, the teams, and a successful season. The parade also featured a temporary Snack Shack, where parents kicked off to grill patties for eager little leaguers.

Now that summer is over, the community has wondered where the project stands.

During the meeting, the commission shared similar remarks on storage and restroom options.

“I think it’s really cool that we’re starting to work on this, I think a lot of the ideas Jake [Lingo] had were really solid, I think that when we go into doing this building, it’s a smart idea that we consider everything that we might need at the Bluffs in terms of infrastructure,” Dane Skophammer said. “It would be nice to get a building that directly represented our needs.”

Questions arose during the meeting: How much storage space would the teams need for storage, how many restrooms they think they would need, and if they need more outdoor seating?

“It would be helpful if Little League can do an inventory of what’s in their storage container and let us know how much storage space they need,” Commissioner Suzanne Guildmann said. “In general, though, you always need more storage than you think you do, so having it big enough to accommodate whatever storage requirements we might have in the future.”

“I do think time is important here, though; this can’t be the skatepark, we can’t wait 10 years for this, I do agree that time has to be part of the decision, but it shouldn’t be our only deciding factor of which one we chose,” Alicia Peak said. “I think the 3,000 square feet to me, should be where we’re aiming. I would like to see, I think four restrooms is fair here, I don’t know if we want to just go so far as to make them all gender-neutral.”

Riesgo said she’s going to give an update in the items requested by January 2024.

Risego moved on to provide department updates such as the erosion cleanup at Charmlee Wilderness Park and the restoration of the bleachers at Malibu Bluffs Park.

For capital improvement projects, Legacy Park closed on Oct. 19 for arbors and benches repairs, there will be sidewalk repairs on Nov. 2 at Malibu Bluffs Park, and Trancas Canyon Park playground will be closed for irrigation and slope repairs.

As for the permanent skatepark, the Environmental Review Board reviewed the skatepark on Oct. 11 meeting; however, concerns in regard to wildlife, ESHA, and noise complaints were raised. The next step would be hearing the proposal from the planning commission. It’s yet to be known when the planning commission will be hearing the proposal.

"'“Those will go for much higher numbers to somebody else, probably not in the region,” Barrett said. “I was just worried about keeping the tournament. So we made it very apparent that we would step back. We would cede the name to the tournament, just to be sure it stayed here.”

Beemok Capital, which bought the Cincinnati Masters tournament from the U.S. Tennis Association in 2022, did not answer questions about the naming rights change. It provided a statement:

“We are embarking on a new era for this historic tennis tournament. By investing hundreds of millions and forging new partnerships, we will leverage its storied past and ensure its future as one of the world’s premiere tennis competitions. We look forward to exploring enhancements to this tournament, including the way it’s positioned nationally and internationally, while remaining true to the Cincinnati community and partnerships that made staying here possible.”

Beemok announced Tuesday that it would keep the prestigious tournament in Mason after state and local governments promised $130 million in public funding for a $260 million expansion of the Lindner Family Tennis Center near Kings Island. Those promises were made in a non-binding memorandum of understanding approved by Warren County Commissioners Tuesday.

Western & Southern was among five local companies that pledged $10 million in corporate sponsorship for the 2024 tournament, which is expected to undergo a temporary name change as Beemok courts potential naming rights partners for 2025.

How much the tournament can fetch from naming rights will depend on whether bidders view it as a global or regional event, said Adam Beissel, an assistant professor who teaches sports-business classes at Miami University.

“I would expect a deal in the range of 20 years at maybe 20 to $30 million over the length of the deal, or about one to $1.5 million per year,” Beissel said. “It’s not really about a return on investment for those title sponsors or expanding your brand reach. What naming rights deals are really about is you’re paying a premium for the perks of entertaining your clients, rewarding your consumers and there’s nothing better than sealing a deal with some courtside seats.”

Because the tournament is an ATP Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 event, it’s already one of the world’s nine biggest tournaments where both men and women compete at the same time. But in 2025, it will expand from nine to 12 days with 96 players instead of the 56 now in its single-player draw.

“It’s two weeks, international television,” Barrett said. “To the right brand that’s selling product worldwide, it might be worth an awful lot.”

Western & Southern has been a tournament sponsor since 2001, making it one of the longest-active partnerships in tennis.

“We invested an awful lot of money in it in the last 20 years to bring in a number three level tennis tournament for women,” Barrett said. “We got it up to the top level. And we got (women) on the same time and the same page (as men). There’s only a few tournaments in the world that do that.”

That history is one reason Western & Southern tried to buy the tournament, only to be outbid by Beemok owner Ben Navarro.

“What we would have done is much along the lines of what Ben’s going to do,” Barrett said. “We wanted to put some heart and soul into the tournament. We were just a sponsor. We weren’t a manager. And there’s so many things we wanted to do differently. The music, the food, the ambience.”

While he’s optimistic for the tournament’s future, he admits it won’t be easy to step away from the role of title sponsor.

“It’s like when your kid gets out of college and moves somewhere else,” said Barrett. “After 22 years, you go, ‘Well, we had a great run — and no regrets.’”'",sports,tennis

"'Homeowners are increasingly concerned with flood insurance premium hikes impacting affordability, Fannie Mae‘s latest national flood survey showed.

Despite people’s personal flooding experience, consumers have a poor understanding of the flood risk of their residence, particularly for those in high-risk zones, according to survey results.

Fannie Mae conducted an online survey in late 2022 among a national panel sample whose addresses were in or near a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defined flood zone.

The survey results were based on nearly 4,000 people nationwide residing in areas across high-risk, medium-risk and locations that were not considered high- and medium-risk areas.

The latest survey is an expansion from its 2020 version and compared how homeowners’ and renters’ awareness and attitudes towards flood risk and flood insurance changed over the years.

Premiums are rising

About 24% of the surveyed respondents said flood insurance is not very or not at all affordable in 2022, compared to 25% in 2020. Some 29% those in high-risk areas saying it is not very or not at all affordable in 2022, a marginal decrease from 31% two years ago.

Notably, the survey showed that this concern was even higher among Hispanic/Latino respondents (34%).

More than half (56%) of those with a separate flood insurance policy said their premium has increased over the last year, which may be driven by the pricing changes brought about under FEMA’s new Risk Rating 2.0 methodology, Fannie Mae said.

FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 methodology is a new risk rating system for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that takes into account variables, such as individual home value and flood risk, which were not factored into previously.

Congress capped annual flood insurance premium hikes at 18%, but Fannie Mae noted “these increases (pricing changes under Risk Rating 2.0) could have tangible impact on consumers.”

Many respondents also noticed increases to their homeowners’ insurance premiums, with about 20% reporting the premium increase to be “significant.”

The average annual cost of flood insurance from the NFIP was $700 per year, but policyholders under the new system pay on average $888.

FEMA’s data showed that the hardest hit homeowners are predominantly in South Florida. In Palm Beach County’s Jupiter Inlet, flood insurance will increase by an average of 342% to $3,449, according to the Miami Herald, which analyzed the FEMA data.

Some zip codes in Louisiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Texas will see double or triple digit increases as well.

“Recent insurance market trends have been unfavorable to consumers across the United States, but especially so in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and California. Certain factors, like the rising severity and frequency of natural disasters, are even leading some insurers to stop writing new policies or pull out of certain states altogether,” said Fannie Mae’s report.

The survey showed respondents were increasingly concerned with possible reductions in home value if their residence were to be designated as located within a high-risk flood zone.

This was most pronounced among respondents with property already located in high-risk areas (29% in 2022 vs. 23% in 2020).

Improving awareness remains a key priority

Fannie Mae’s survey found that one-in-eight respondents have experienced a flood at their current residence, with half reporting experiencing flooding in the past five years.

Flooding experience was more prevalent among Black respondents, with one-in-five Black respondents (20%) responding they have had a flood at their current residence.

In comparison, 14% of Hispanic/Latino respondents and 13% of White respondents reported the same. This higher degree of personal experience with flooding might help explain why Black respondents perceived a higher risk of flooding in their community and their homes relative to others, the survey noted.

Only 41% of respondents in high-risk areas and 30% in medium-risk areas said they were informed of flood risk prior to moving into their current home.

Moving forward, the results of this survey indicate that significant work remains to educate consumers on flood risk and mitigation options, Fannie Mae noted.

FEMA continued to be cited as the most trusted source for flood risk information, growing since 2020 (47% 2022 vs. 41% 2020), followed by other government agencies (10%) and insurance agents (7%).

“There is more that the housing industry, government institutions, and other stakeholders can do to enhance consumer-focused communications, ensure access to reliable flood-risk information, and to make it easier for consumers to make informed choices about whether flood insurance is right for them,” said Fannie Mae.'",climate,flood
"'Today, Google announced a number of AI-powered sustainability features for end users and public officials, like Flood Hub in the US and Project Green Light.

Back in 2018, Google started providing real-time flooding information powered by AI and geospatial analysis. Google is now bringing its Flood Hub riverine flood forecasts to the US and Canada. This covers over 800 locations by rivers where more than 12 million people live. The tool already works in 80 countries.

Google Search has added a Fuel Cost Calculator in 21 countries, letting prospective EV buyers compare charging costs with filling up at a gas station. Additionally, you’ll get the ability to “Explore battery range” to see how far a car can go on a single charge.

Drivers can also customize a route to see how many charges are needed along the way based on factors like elevation change and speed limits. These battery range insights roll out in the U.S. in the coming weeks and in Europe early next year.

On the travel front, Search will soon suggest train routes when looking up flights. After coming to the US, Canada, Europe, and Egypt, fuel-efficient routing in Google Maps is coming to India and Indonesia this year with support for two-wheel vehicles. In France, Maps will soon suggest public transit and walking for driving routes if they are “comparable and practical.”

Google will also surface efficiency information and financial incentives when you search for heat pumps and air conditioning units.

Outside of consumer-facing features, Google is releasing new tools for city officials and other public planners. Project Green Light uses AI and Google Maps driving trends to optimize traffic light plans. Recommendations can be used to improve traffic flow and reduce stop-and-go emissions by coordinating nearby intersections to have “waves of green light.” Google imagines the tool helping reduce stops by up to 30%, with availability in more cities next year.

Green Light is now live in 70 intersections in 12 cities from Haifa to Rio de Janeiro to Bangalore – and in these intersections we are able to save fuel and lower emissions for up to 30M car rides monthly.

Google is also collaborating to make the “biggest update in 50 years” to the US Forest Service’s fire spread models. It follows the company’s existing work to track wildfire boundaries.

This model leverages machine learning (ML) to model more fire dynamics to help fire authorities train firefighters, plan effective fuel treatments and battle large-scale fires more safely and effectively while in the field.'",climate,forest fire

The Kansas City Chiefs came away as 21-14 winners Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, but they didn't exactly run through the tape.

Kansas City opened up a 21-point lead and proceeded to watch its offense run aground in the second half. The Dolphins got as far as the Chiefs' 31-yard line as they attempted to tie the game inside the final two minutes. An errant snap on fourth down ended Miami's comeback attempt.

For Tyreek Hill, it wasn't a happy reunion with his old team. Not only did he come out on the losing end, but he was also involved in one of the most pivotal moments of the game. The four-time All-Pro fumbled the ball with 44 seconds left in the first half and watched the Chiefs defense scoop it up and score.

Hill's trash talk, no matter how friendly, came back to bite him a little bit.

While the outcome wasn't as one-sided as it was shaping up to be, it's another defeat for Miami against an opponent with Super Bowl aspirations. The Dolphins did nothing to shed the label they're merely flat-track bullies.

Along with Hill, Tua Tagovailoa received his fair share of criticism after going 21-of-34 for 193 yards and a touchdown.'",sports,football

"'Coco Gauff has made a name for herself at a young age for being an exceptional tennis athlete, inspiring people around the world. Though her success ultimately can be accredited to her hard work and talent, Gauff’s story is not complete without the mention of her parents. Gauff has praised parents Candi and Corey Gauff for being her biggest supporters, fans and sources of inspiration. Learn here everything to know about Coco Gauff’s parents and what led them to raising the tennis champion known today.

Who Is Coco Gauff?

Before diving into Gauff ‘s parents, let’s learn more about the young tennis star and the feats she has achieved so early into her career. Cori “Coco” Gauff is a highly talented professional tennis player from the United States. She was born on March 13, 2004, in Atlanta, Georgia. Gauff rose to prominence at a very young age due to her exceptional skills on the tennis court.

She gained widespread attention in 2019 when, at just 15 years old, she made a remarkable run at Wimbledon. Gauff, as a wildcard entry, defeated her idol Venus Williams in the first round, becoming the youngest player to win a Wimbledon match since 1991. Since then, Gauff has continued to showcase her talent and potential in various tournaments. Her style of play is characterized by powerful groundstrokes, speed, agility, and a strong mental game. Gauff has also achieved success in doubles competitions and has been praised for her sportsmanship and positive attitude. Beyond her skills as a tennis player, she has become an inspirational figure for many young athletes around the world. Gauff’s coaches/parents are highly responsible for the heights their daughter has been able to take her career to. Here’s more about Coco Gauff’s parents.

Who Are Coco Gauff’s Parents?

Coco Gauff’s parents are Corey Gauff and Candi Gauff. The couple have been married for over 20 years, celebrating 23 years of marriage in January. Before marrying and becoming parents to a tennis legend-in-the-making, the Gauffs were athletes and nearly made it big themselves. Candi Gauff was a part of the Florida State University track and field team where her performance in a heptathlon event is still regarded as one of the best scores in the school’s history. Candi also won several other awards and championships for her athleticism in college and even before then in high school. Additionally, Corey Gauff was an athlete in college as a basketball player for Georgia State University.

Despite having their own athletic talent they could have passed down, the Gauffs credit all of Coco’s accomplishments to her own years of hard work rather than just being a prodigy. However, Corey told The New York Times that he believes he and Candi’s experience with college athletics helped them to understand professional sports better and to raise a professional athlete.

The Gauffs introduced Coco to a variety of sports at a young age, but everything changed when they realized her potential at tennis when she was just eight years old. Weaver wrote that Corey and Candi moved from their home in Atlanta back to their hometown of Delray Beach, Florida, to raise her and dedicate their time to her tennis career with the most familial support. Candi, who worked as a teacher, quit her job to homeschool Coco. The family also moved in with Candi’s parents to save money and be able to better help Coco with her career financially. Eventually, Corey left his job as a healthcare worker to become Coco’s full time coach.

Corey and Candi are also parents to Coco’s younger brothers Cody (16) and Cameron (10) Gauff. The two boys also have interests in athletics, with basketball being their sport of choice. Corey and Candi encouraged all of their children to go after their dreams, whatever they may be.

Who Is Corey Gauff?

Corey Gauff’s relationship with his daughter Coco is comparable to that of the famous Richard Williams, father and coach of sister tennis legends Venus and Serena Williams. Corey quit his job as the family’s breadwinner to devote his time to learning the sport of tennis and being Coco’s coach. Much of his preparation entailed studying the careers and support systems behind tennis players who started young, especially the Williams sisters and their father.

Candi Gauff told ESPN in 2022, “If it wasn’t for the Williams sisters, Coco would not be a tennis player. “And if it wasn’t for Richard, my husband would not have studied tennis in that format. He’s patented himself off [Richard Williams] and used their roadmap.”

Corey had a plan to see Coco’s career take off in 10 years or by the time she was 18. He dedicated all his time and energy to not only training his daughter, but also finding her the right mentors and other resources to help her improve her skills.

Corey did not just coach his daughter on playing tennis but also on how to handle herself mentally on and off the court. Randi Richardson and Drew Weisholtz wrote for Today that Corey and Candi were all about “positive sports parenting,” and that Corey would emphasize the importance of cheering yourself on and having good body language on the court to Coco. Because of her Dad’s encouragement, Coco told reporters after her iconic 2019 Wimbledon win against Venus Williams, “I’ve said this before; I want to be the greatest. My dad told me I could do this when I was 8, and obviously, you never believe it. I’m still not 100 percent confident, but you have to say things and believe in them and see what happens.”

Corey Gauff is no longer the head coach of his daughter but Coco has stated many times that he is still heavily present in every match she plays and in whatever encouragement she needs.

Who Is Candi Gauff?

While Corey Gauff spent years as Coco Gauff’s on-the-court supporter, Candi Gauff was determined to be there for her daughter in every other way. Candi told The New York Times in 2019 that she purposefully lets her husband handle all of the coaching.

“I try to back away on the court because too many voices can be a crowd,” Candi said. “I let my husband be the coach, and I’m the supportive mom, the one if she hurts or is crying that she can communicate with.”

Candi helped Coco with her education and chose to remain as her daughter’s escape when she wanted to get away from tennis for a moment. She even worked as a mediator between Corey and Coco when the two would argue or have disagreements related to tennis on and off the court. Being this supportive figure for her daughter has proved to be crucial in Coco’s journey as she continuously praises her parents and thanks them for the support and encouragement they have always given her.

The Gauff Family

Coco Gauff’s parents, Candi and Corey Gauff, are a true testament to what good parenting and supporting a child can do for them and their future. Sometimes, simply having talent like Coco Gauff had at a young age is not enough. A support system like Candi and Corey that does not stand for quitting while simultaneously being a figure of love and validation is what can build a path to success.'",sports,tennis
"'WIMBLEDON, England -- One London newspaper dubbed it the ""Battle of the Blondes."" Another pantingly proclaimed ""Babes Bid for Totty Title.""

Who will fill Anna's shoes?

""It's the greatest match in the history of players who can't play,"" joked Bud Collins, the venerable tennis scribe and television commentator.

Indeed, the dozens of reporters and photographers on hand for Tuesday's first-round Wimbledon match between unseeded up-and-comers Ashley Harkleroad and Maria Sharapova seemed less concerned with checking out a pair of potential top-10 players than with ... simply checking them out.

That, in turn, raised the question: With Page 2 favorite Anna Kournikova out of the picture, who pouts supreme as the fortnight's foremost hottie?

""People have been thinking that women are, you know, very nice, very pretty on the court,"" Sharapova protested after notching a straight-set win over Harkleroad. ""It's not just about going out there and being pretty.""

Maybe not. But given Kournikova's staggering endorsement-to-results ratio, beauty certainly doesn't hurt.

Herein, a handy clip-n-save guide to Wimbledon's substitute Annas:

The grunt definitely doesn't stop here.

Maria Sharapova

""K""-redentials: Nick Bollettieri protege recently signed a generous endorsement deal with a major shoe and apparel company, even though she's never won a pro tournament. Sorta like you-know-who.

Double Fault: Officials at the DFS Classic in Birmingham, England, asked her to tone down her grunting. Said Sharapova: ""I try not to make noise. But it's just something that I've been doing all of my life."" You go, girl!

Ashley Harkleroad

Who's that Girl: An 18-year-old from Flintstone, Ga., who upset Daniela Hantuchova at the French Open and has been dubbed ""the American Anna."" Not that Harkleroad minds. ""It's not that I want to be like her,"" she once said of the divine Miss K. ""I just like to be compared with her. I like the attention.""

""K""-redentials: In 2001, made her U.S. Open debut in a midriff-bearing, memorably tight shirt-and-skirt combo. Told reporters afterward that her Britney-esque getup was ""tight and short, but I like it like that."" Also has signed with Michael Ovitz's Artists Management Group, ensuring a potentially bright future of halfhearted acting lessons, ill-advised film cameos and other off-court distractions.

Double Fault: Frankly, U.S. Open outfit was bit unflattering.

Daniela Hantuchova

NORTHLAKE, Texas — A small earthquake was detected near Northlake in Denton County late Thursday night, according to officials.

A 2.2-scale earthquake was picked up shortly before midnight on the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) earthquake map.

The map said the earthquake was detected about two miles north of Northlake, which is a small community southwest of Denton. It was about four kilometers deep, according to the USGS.

It wasn't immediately clear if the earthquake was felt; quakes in the 2.0 range on the Richter scale are considered minor and may only be felt slightly. They often don't result in any damage.'",climate,earthquake
"'Is international athlete recruitment moving HBCUs away from their original mission?

Grunts, sneaker squeaks and the thud of rackets striking fluorescent yellow-green balls echoed throughout the South Fulton Tennis Center on a hot and humid September weekend.

Seventeen historically Black college and university tennis teams nationwide competed in men’s and women’s singles and doubles to become national champions.

This Year on WABE: 2023 This Year on WABE: 2023 2023 was a big year at WABE. We turned 75, launched WABE Studios, and the WABE Newsroom continued to cover the critical issues Atlantans care about most. Here are a handful of stories, photos, television and podcasts we think stand out from this year.

Make that international.

NCCU sophomore tennis player Alejandra Hidalgo Vega. (Julien Virgin/WABE) “I always wanted to play in the U.S. because I want to, like, a scholarship and be able to, you know, be in a university here,” says Alejandra Hidalgo Vega. Vega is a sophomore at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and is the reigning Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) conference rookie of the year. Born and raised in Madrid, Spain, she began playing tennis at the age of six with her family. Now, she’s on a full scholarship in Durham, North Carolina.

“I really enjoy being in HBCU — I have a lot of fun,” Vega said.

The experience has allowed Vega to explore the world and learn about African-American culture — one she was unfamiliar with before coming to America.

Vegas says she paid All American Athletics, a Madrid-based recruiting service, to help her land a full scholarship in the United States. She says she had partial scholarship offers from other schools but committed to NCCU before visiting the campus.

Scouting athletes through third-party international sports recruiters has become a big practice in the U.S., including HBCUs and sports like tennis, golf and baseball. That’s according to Dr. Ashley Brown-Grier, a Fulbright U.S. student researcher in South Africa who studies internationalization at historically Black colleges.

“For HBCUs, that works two ways because now we’re able to retain top student athletic talent. And we’re also able to diversify our student bodies,” Brown-Grier says.

According to the NCAA, just under 6,000 international student-athletes competed in 1999-2000. Twenty years later, that number has more than tripled — that includes HBCUs.

However, some students and coaches, such as Tuskegee University’s head tennis coach, Gregory Green, believe HBCUs are moving away from the mission the institutions were ultimately created for.

“We feel that there’s a lot of Black students that need the opportunity to go to college and play tennis,” said Green, adding, “Those are the ones we recruit. And we want to keep it home. This is an HBCU, and we’re going to stick to that all the way through.”

Green has four international students on the roster. But Green says all of them are Black and from Africa.

“There’s no need for me to bring a kid in from Ireland or Switzerland or [Norway] because they’re not helping our community,” he said. “And that’s one of the main missions of HBCUs was to provide our kids the opportunity to be great.”

Green started his coaching career at fellow HBCU Savannah State University in the ’90s. He says HBCUs weren’t always looking to Europe to fill roster spots.

“I don’t know why they started going [with] so much of the student-athletes that don’t look like us,” Green said. “I don’t know why. You should ask Alabama State.”

“Tennis is an international sport.” Anuk Christiainsz, Alabama State University’s head tennis coach

Alabama State University’s Head Tennis Coach Anuk Christiansz (Julien Virgin) Anuk Christiansz is Alabama State University’s head tennis coach. “Tennis is an international sport,” said Christainsz, whose roster is all international students, most from European countries like France, Slovenia and England. “I would love to see more African Americans playing tennis and get to a level where they can play college tennis at the highest level… But they need to go to the next three, four levels so that they can be on par with everyone else,” Christainsz said.

Christainsz has won six national championships and coached 31 All-Americans during his tenure,

Alabama State’s athletic director backs his coaches’ recruiting tactics, saying diversity is a pillar of his program. And that anytime you’re in a competitive environment, you want the best talent available.

As the landscape for collegiate athletics continues to evolve — including players getting paid for their name, image and likeness — athletic departments at HBCUs will have to find a way to balance winning at their sports with the mission of why the universities were created.'",sports,tennis
"'WILLIAMSPORT – There is no dispute Theresa Robinson Salazar drove a minivan through the front doors of the World of Little League Museum last year.

But had she formed the intent to kill or injure when she did so? That is the question a Lycoming County jury will decide Thursday.

Judge Eric R. Linhardt after the prosecution rested Wednesday denied a defense motion to dismiss an attempted homicide and two aggravated assault charges against the Williamsport woman.

A minivan can be seen well inside the front doors of the World of Little League museum along Route 15 in South Williamsport after crashing into it on July 3, 2022.

Defense attorney Helen A. Stolinas argued the prosecution failed to establish intent and added that her client did not know museum coordinator Melissa Mull, identified in the charges as the intended victim.

Assistant District Attorney Matthew B. Welickovitch responded that Salazar stopped the vehicle after it went through the first set of two doors and then stepped on the accelerator as Mull was approaching.

Mull, who suffered a cut hand from flying glass, was the only one injured in the 1 p.m. July 3, 2022, incident.

There were approximately 40 people in the museum in the Little League headquarters complex along Route 15 in South Williamsport.

Jurors saw videos and still pictures of the minivan crashing through the front door, stop, and then continuing on through gift shop displays and into a wall.

One of the videos showed one of the front wheels spinning on the rim with smoke rising.

Mull testified she believed Salazar’s conduct was intentional. She was cocky, smirky, appeared very satisfied at what she had done, and showed no remorse, she said.

As she approached the vehicle to see if the driver needed medical help, Mull said Salazar through the open passenger front seat window proclaimed:

“I’m Theresa Salazar. You know who I am. You should be afraid.” When Salazar reached down, Mull said she thought she was going for a gun. “I thought that was it,” she said.

When Salazar repeated several times, “You should be afraid,” Mull said she ordered everyone out of the building.

“I was afraid of what she might do and what she was capable of,” she testified.

The incident was part of a more than 20-year feud over who founded Little League Baseball.

The documented history is Stotz created Little League in 1939 and asked George and Bert Bebble to manage two of the first three teams. Stotz managed the third.

Salazar, their great niece, maintains the Bebbles should be recognized as co-founders.

As Stolinas acknowledged, Salazar since 2001 had been a “thorn in Little League’s side” trying to return the legacy of her family.

Those efforts consisted of mostly letter writing early on followed by a pause until about five years ago.

In 2021 she sought to have the district attorney’s office approve criminal charges claiming Little League illegally had more than 60 memorabilia items belonging to the Bebble family.

Charges were not approved after an investigation that included reviewing documents in Little League’s possession about the memorabilia, said Arnold Duck Jr. the county detective who conducted it.

The testimony of Patrick W. Wilson, Little League’s chief operating officer, was used by Welickovitch to introduce some of Salazar’s activities in recent years.

Two Lycoming County deputy sheriffs escort a smiling Theresa Salazar out of the county courthouse on Sept. 6, 2022, after she was held for court on charges related to her ramming a minivan through the front doors of the World of Little League Museum in South Williamsport earlier that summer.

They included claiming Little League was her organization, demanding to be put on the payroll and having notarized documents stating she was the sole executrix of Little League.

Jurors heard the voicemail messages Salazar left for Stephen D. Keener, Little League’s president and CEO, the night before and the morning of the incident that included demands for a meeting and compensation for the Bebble family.

Stolinas pointed out several times her client never threatened violence and that she had the right to voice her opinion.

The incident could have been catastrophic, Welickovitch pointed out. A couple with two young children had been in the gift shop less than an hour earlier, he said.

Also, a museum employee would have been walking out the door as the minivan crashed in had Mull not delayed her to show her something on a computer, he said.

The cost of temporary and permanent repairs to the museum totaled $74,701, Brian McClintock, Little League’s senior communications executive, said.

Stolinas told the judge she would be meeting with her client to discuss whether she wanted to testify in the trial’s second day. Salazar is being held without bail.

Besides the three counts, Linhardt refused to dismiss, Salazar is charged with risking a catastrophe, terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person, criminal trespass and criminal mischief.'",sports,baseball
"'Patients aged 65 and over or with pre-existing health conditions are at higher risk from overheating in hospital wards - E+

Hot NHS hospitals are risking patient safety as overheating wards hit a record high last year, new figures show.

There were more than 6,800 cases of wards or clinical areas exceeding 26C (79F) in 2022-23, which the NHS says puts vulnerable patients at risk.

The number of incidents reported by hospitals was up by almost a quarter on the year before, and more than double the 2,980 incidents that occurred six years ago in 2016-17, the analysis of NHS data by the Liberal Democrat Party revealed.

Opposition MPs said the incidents were “a threat to patient safety” and causing “needless disruption”.

Patients aged 65 and over or with pre-existing health conditions, such as those affecting the lungs or heart, are at higher risk from overheating.

Once temperatures surpass 26C, these vulnerable groups “are physiologically unable to cool themselves efficiently”, the NHS says.

This can lead to heat exhaustion and, if untreated, develop into heatstroke, which requires emergency intervention to cool the body.

IT meltdown

Hot wards and clinical areas can also affect patient care in other, less direct ways.

A recent report said that overheating had caused issues with refrigerators used to store medicines, the failure of essential hospital equipment and the crashing of IT systems that hold patient information.

As temperatures in Britain reached record highs of 40C in July 2022, the heatwave caused computer systems at one of the NHS’s biggest hospital trusts, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, to fail and patients’ care to be disrupted and operations cancelled.

IT systems are used to upload scan results, which can then be accessed by doctors, but if systems go offline, staff are forced to return to using pen and paper.

A fifth of hospitals were forced to cancel operations during the peak of that heatwave, according to a study published in the British Journal of Surgery, with staff shortages and “unsafe theatre environments” the most common causes.

‘Occupational health risk’

A separate report, produced by the campaign group Round Our Way, said staff also suffered from working in hot conditions, which could in turn affect patient care.

“In addition to patient distress, high temperatures also pose an occupational health risk to NHS staff,” it said.

It cited evidence that the “cognitive performance” of doctors and nurses decreased at high, or even mild, temperatures of 24C, lowering their productivity.

Experts have also found that as many as nine in 10 hospital wards are at risk of overheating because of the design of buildings.

With a third of the NHS estate built before 1965 – more than 50 years before the recording of overheating incidents began – the buildings are primarily designed to keep heat in, rather than cool.

The new figures also revealed there had been a surge in the number of fires and floods across hospitals compared with the previous year.

There were 279 serious flooding incidents in 2022-23, which was an increase of 59 per cent on the year before. These occur when water causes disruption to services by entering a building or flooding an access road.

There was also an 18 per cent rise in the number of fires year-on-year, with 1,372 recorded last year – that is almost four a day on average.

‘Crumbling hospital buildings’

Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, said the rise in incidents “must act as a wake-up call to ministers to fix crumbling hospital buildings before it’s too late”.

“The government has failed to upgrade run-down and ageing hospitals, leaving them particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events,” she said.

“Every day, people are being treated in old and dilapidated buildings because the Conservatives have failed to deliver on the new hospitals they promised. This is leading to countless incidents that pose a threat to the safety of patients and to staff, and needless disruption as wards have to be shut down.”

It comes after it was revealed earlier this year that dozens of hospital buildings have the aerated concrete known as RAAC, with seven hospitals built entirely out of the material and having to prop up ceilings with rods and poles, costing the taxpayer millions of pounds a year.

The Government has made a commitment to rebuilding the seven hospitals by 2030 as part of the New Hospital Programme and eliminating RAAC from the rest of the NHS estate by 2035.

"'Wildfires and drought have led to $11.2 billion in damages to privately held timberland in California, Oregon and Washington over the past two decades, a new Oregon State University study found.

That represents about a 10% reduction in the value of private timberland in the three states. Based on recent climate change attribution studies by other scientists, the authors of the study attribute about half of the economic damages to climate change.

While past research has estimated impacts of climate change on the value of forests in the future, researchers were interested in how climate change has already affected the value of forests in the new study.

“This study shows that climate change is already reducing the value of western forests,” said David Lewis, a natural resource economist at Oregon State. “This isn’t a hypothetical future effect. These are damages that have already happened because it is riskier to hold assets like timberland.”

The study , published in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, is being released shortly after the White House announced plans to develop a national strategy to estimate the impacts of climate change on the value of the nation’s natural capital, such as forests, minerals, oceans and rivers.

For the study, Lewis and postdoctoral scholar Yuhan Wang, who led the work, analyzed a dataset of just over 9,000 sales of privately-owned timberland that were a minimum of 10 acres from 2004 to 2020 in California, Oregon and Washington.

They then linked the transactions with data on small and large wildfires along with data on drought stress accessed by a measure known as vapor pressure deficit.

They found that across the three states the recent increases in drought stress have already reduced the economic value of timberland by 1% on average while increases in large wildfires have reduced timberland values by an additional 8.7% over the past two decades.

The research also showed that the bulk of large wildfire-induced losses (nearly 7.4% of the 8.7%) were not due to direct burning of private timberland, but instead related to increasingly frequent neighboring fires that have altered landowners’ expectations of fire arrival and increased risk of investing in private timberland, the authors say.

“The bulk of the damage is from altered risk expectations in land markets – not direct damage to the existing tree stock on the stand,” Wang said. “That is a key and somewhat surprising finding.”

In the three-state study region, about one-third of all forests are privately owned, with the remainder owned by federal, state and local governments, the authors note. However, most of the timber harvested – and almost all the timberland bought and sold – is privately held.

The researchers broke down the findings by state and also by east and west of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington. Findings include:

In California, drought stress accounted for a .2% gain in timberland value and a 13.7% decrease due to large wildfires. The drought stress gain is in part a result of most of the private timberland being concentrated in the wetter northwestern region of the state.

In Oregon west of the Cascades, drought stress losses were 1.6%, and large wildfire losses were 7.7%. East of the Cascades, drought stress dropped to 1.1%, and large wildfire loss declined to 6%. The difference between east and west of the Cascades in Oregon is in large part because there is more private timberland west of the Cascades that has been in close proximity to large wildfires in recent years.

In Washington, west of the Cascades, drought stress led to a .2% loss in timberland value, and large wildfire caused a 5% decrease in timberland value. East of the Cascades, the losses were 3.5% due to drought stress and 8.1% because of large wildfires.

The authors note that the findings have several policy implications. They show that climate change can alter the value of natural capital, in this case private timberland, and impact private investments and potentially require public intervention to prevent management changes.

Also, the findings provide new insights into estimating wildfire damages, beyond property losses, health care costs, injuries, fire suppression costs and air and water quality damages.

“The study helps us understand the effects of historical climate shocks on the economic value of natural capital and also provides insights into the potential benefits of actions to mitigate extreme weather events,” Wang said.

"'Agribusiness consultant Mark Grewel stands on a farm road that was flooded near Corcoran after heavy rains in the San Joaquin Valley last March.

Less than a year after facing historic water shortages, California this week was declared drought-free thanks to a year of epic rains, with an El Niño forecast that could keep wet conditions going into 2024.

The U.S. Drought monitor’s latest data show the vast majority of California reporting no drought as of Oct. 17, though pockets in the northernmost and southeastern parts of the state are still considered abnormally dry.

“For the most part, California had been drought-free” for weeks, but “a little smidgen” remained, said Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska.

Advertisement

A smidgen, indeed: On Oct. 10, only 0.7% of the state was in drought. And that area — a slim portion of Del Norte County in the upper left-hand corner of the state — had been getting consistently less dry since mid-September.

Just a year ago, 99.8% of California was in some level of drought, and 43% of the state was in extreme or exceptional drought, the two most serious levels.

California hasn’t been completely drought-free since two fleeting periods in 2019 and 2020, which were preceded and followed by prolonged dry spells.

The state was drought-free from March to September in 2019, then experienced moderate drought in 1% to 2% of the state before being officially free of drought from November 2019 to February 2020, according to U.S. Drought Monitor data.

Before those instances, “it was all the way back to December 2011” when the state was completely drought-free, Fuchs said.

Part of the reason for the prevalence of drought in the state is California’s size and varied geographic makeup: “The odds of drought somewhere in the state during a [given] time period,” Fuchs said, “doesn’t seem that uncommon.”

Even taking into account size and range of geography, drought has had an outsize effect on the state.

The Drought Mitigation Center’s nationwide models are based on a long list of factors: precipitation, snowpack, river levels and more, Fuchs said.

For an area to be declared abnormally dry, most readings must be in the bottom 30th percentile of moisture.

To enter drought status, an area must be within the bottom 20th percentile, which corresponds to a moderate drought.

Extreme drought describes measurements in the 5th percentile of moisture. Exceptional drought is reserved for the 2nd percentile and below, meaning only one or two years out of 100 sampled have ever been as dry, Fuchs said.

Much of the Central Valley was in exceptional drought on Nov. 1, 2022. But after a series of winter atmospheric rivers that showered the Golden State with rain and replenished a depleted snowpack, much of the state exited its drought.

By March, Gov. Gavin Newsom had lifted a number of drought-related restrictions, citing the wet winter.

As the record-setting snowpack melted, rivers and streams across the state carried even more water to previously parched areas. By August, only 6.5% of the state was in drought.

And then Hurricane Hilary, downgraded to a tropical storm by the time it reached California, dumped even more rain on some of the most stubbornly dry regions.

Fuchs was hopeful that the looming El Niño winter — which could bring wetter-than-average conditions to California — might keep the state out of drought.

“Last winter was tremendous as a whole,” he said. “Maybe a couple wet years here will turn the tide.”

He pointed to the seasonal drought outlook issued by the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center, which “shows all of California staying drought-free” through January.

On top of that, coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest that remain drought-stricken are projected to be helped by another wet winter, although drought conditions are expected to persist or worsen in Eastern Washington and central Oregon.

El Niño events usually signify a warmer, drier winter and fall in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, per the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Though the predictions extend only through January, “right now the projections are looking quite good, with an El Niño winter building upon the very favorable winter we saw last year,” Fuchs said.

All in all, “we could see the state continue to stay drought-free in 2024,” he said.

Although another wet winter would help stave off drought, it raises the specter of fresh disaster, according to experts.

Like last winter, the state could see levee breaches and flooding after a series of rain- and snow-induced disasters in late 2022 and early 2023.

At least 22 people died in the powerful storms that struck the state in late December and early January, according to Los Angeles Times reporting.

Massive snowstorms killed 12 people in the San Bernardino Mountains in early March.

A levee failure on the Pajaro River in Monterey County led to extensive flooding and prompted hundreds of evacuations and dozens of water rescues.

Along with the risks posed by a potentially wetter-than-normal winter to come, the state still faces a changing climate and the possibility of lingering effects from so many years of drought, according to Fuchs.

“Even when conditions start improving,” Fuchs worries that the landscape across the West could remain damaged by drought.

As a climate scientist, he wonders: “Was there any damage in the forests that will lead to increased fire danger even after the drought” has ended?

Fuchs notes that the state’s groundwater remained severely depleted, even after so much precipitation.

And although Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which hold so much of the water Southern Californians use, may have recovered somewhat, numerous dry years have shrunk their levels substantially.

“Even though we don’t see any drought in those areas right now,” he said, “we’re still seeing some of those longer-term impacts.”

When drought inevitably returns, Fuchs worries that forests, groundwater reserves and vital reservoirs may quickly revert to a state of crisis.

“I would hope that the folks out in California and the West as a whole, that conservation is always on the forefront of our minds,” he said of climate change and resiliency.

“Let’s make sure we use our water wisely,” he added, “and that we have some when things do get dry.”'",climate,drought
"'Port Neches Little League President Trey Gaspard says the children seen vandalizing the facility appear to be 9-12 years old.

Example video title will go here for this video

PORT NECHES, Texas — The Port Neches Little League facilities are being cleaned up following destruction left from vandals from over the weekend.

This is the second time in a month that the Little League has been targeted and it was caught on camera.

Port Neches Little League President Trey Gaspard says the shocking part is surveillance video shows those vandals appear to be 9-12 years old.

Gaspard says they are a nonprofit organization and these repairs cost money. Now, they are forced to ask for donations to pay for the damage.

""Just trying to get a better awareness for respect of property that's especially not theirs,"" Gaspard said.

In surveillance video, a group of kids tug on the concession stand metal hurricane protection cover. Once opened, they hit the windows with sticks.

""And then the older taller one looks to throw an object through the window causing the break,"" he said.

Gaspard is trying to comprehend this senseless act.

""They were bored and thought it was just fun to destroy property. There were no attempts made to get into the concession stand, which I'm grateful for,"" he said.

Last month, he says a group of kids destroyed the league's women's restroom.

""Some vandals came in and plugged the drains in the sink, left the water running, smashed the tank lids on both toilets, and basically demolished the changing station,"" he said.

The league is ordering a new window and wants to add more locked gates but it's expensive.

""It's just a struggle to get the right amount of sponsorships and donations to just maintain the facilities. But now, we have to worry about incidents taking place and improve damaged goods that should've never been damaged in the first place,"" he said.

The league wants to lend a hand out to troubled youth.

""We really, truly feel like it's kids like this that need a league like this. It'll help get them off the damage route of just damaging things. You come to a league like this and we got discipline ship,"" he said.

"'CHARLOTTE, N.C. – A burn ban has been put into effect for another 16 western North Carolina counties due to an increasing risk of wildfires, according to the North Carolina Forest Service.

This notice went into effect on Wednesday, November 8th at 5 p.m. The ban will remain in effect until further notice.

The counties affected by this issue include: Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Caldwell, Catawba, Haywood, Iredell, Lincoln, Madison, Mecklenburg, Mitchell, Watauga, Wilkes and Yancey County.

The forest services say the open burning ban has been put into place to help prevent an increase in wildfires due to the extremely dry conditions in western North Carolina. Officials say the ban applies to all open burning regardless if a person has attained a burning permit.

The ban prohibits burning leaves, branches, plant material, trash, lumber, tires, newspapers, plastics or other non-vegetative materials. Additionally, recreation fires, bonfires and outdoor fireplaces are prohibited.

Cooking fires via gas, pellet, charcoal grills or outdoor cookers and smokers are still allowed.

This notice comes three days after the North Carolina Forest Service issued a burn ban to 14 counties due to hazardous forest fire conditions.

No exceptions will be made, and violations in the 16 counties will carry a minimum $100 fine plus $180 in court costs.'",climate,heatwave
"'By ISABEL DEBRE

JERUSALEM — Fistfights break out in bread lines. Residents wait hours for a gallon of brackish water that makes them sick. Scabies, diarrhea and respiratory infections rip through overcrowded shelters. And some families have to choose who eats.

“My kids are crying because they are hungry and tired and can’t use the bathroom,” said Suzan Wahidi, an aid worker and mother of five at a U.N. shelter in the central town of Deir al-Balah, where hundreds of people share a single toilet. “I have nothing for them.”

With the Israel-Hamas war in its second month and more than 10,000 people killed in Gaza, trapped civilians are struggling to survive without electricity or running water. Palestinians who managed to flee Israel’s ground invasion in northern Gaza now encounter scarcity of food and medicine in the south, and there is no end in sight to the war sparked by Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attack.

Over half a million displaced people have crammed into hospitals and U.N. schools-turned-shelters in the south. The schools — overcrowded, strewn with trash, swarmed by flies — have become a breeding ground for infectious diseases.

UPDATE: Israel agrees to 4-hour daily pauses in Gaza fighting to allow civilians to flee

Since the start of the war, several hundred trucks of aid have entered Gaza through the southern Rafah crossing, but aid organizations say that’s a drop in the ocean of need. For most people, each day has become a drudging cycle of searching for bread and water and waiting in lines.

The sense of desperation has strained Gaza’s close-knit society, which has endured decades of conflict, four wars with Israel and a 16-year blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces.

Some Palestinians have even vented their anger against Hamas, shouting insults at officials or beating up policemen in scenes unimaginable just a month ago, witnesses say.

“Everywhere you go, you see tension in the eyes of people,” said Yousef Hammash, an aid worker with the Norwegian Refugee Council in the southern town of Khan Younis. “You can tell they are at a breaking point.”

Supermarket shelves are nearly empty. Bakeries have shut down because of lack of flour and fuel for the ovens. Gaza’s farmland is mostly inaccessible, and there’s little in produce markets beyond onions and oranges. Families cook lentils over small fires in the streets.

“You hear children crying in the night for sweets and hot food,” said Ahmad Kanj, 28, a photographer at a shelter in the southern town of Rafah. “I can’t sleep.”

Many people say they’ve gone weeks without meat, eggs or milk and now live on one meal a day.

“There is a real threat of malnutrition and people starving,” said Alia Zaki, spokesperson for the U.N.’s World Food Program. What aid workers call “food insecurity” is the new baseline for Gaza’s 2.3 million people, she said.

Famed Gazan dishes like jazar ahmar — juicy red carrots stuffed with ground lamb and rice — are a distant memory, replaced by dates and packaged biscuits. Even those are hard to find.

Each day families send their most assertive relative off before dawn to one of the few bakeries still functioning. Some take knives and sticks — they say they must prepare to defend themselves if attacked, with riots sporadically breaking out in bread and water lines.

“I send my sons to the bakeries and eight hours later, they’ve come back with bruises and sometimes not even bread,” said 59-year-old Etaf Jamala, who fled Gaza City for the southern town of Deir al-Balah, where she sleeps in the packed halls of a hospital with 15 family members.

One woman told The Associated Press that her nephew, a 27-year-old father of five in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya in northern Gaza, was stabbed in the back with a kitchen knife after being accused of cutting the line for water. He needed dozens of stitches, she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The violence has jarred the tiny territory, where family names are linked to community status and even small discretions can be magnified in the public eye.

“The social fabric for which Gaza was known is fraying due to the anxiety and uncertainty and loss,” said Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees.

Israel cut off water to Gaza shortly after the Hamas attack, saying its complete siege would be lifted only after the militants released the roughly 240 hostages they captured. Israel has since turned on pipelines to the center and south, but there’s no fuel to pump or process the water. The taps run dry.

Those who can’t find or afford bottled water rely on salty, unfiltered well water, which doctors say causes diarrhea and serious gastrointestinal infections.

“I cannot recognize my own son,” said Fadi Ihjazi. The 3-year-old has lost 5 kilograms (11 pounds) in just two weeks, she said, and has been diagnosed with a chronic intestinal infection.

“Before the war he had the sweetest baby face,” Ihjazi said, but now his lips are chapped, his face yellowish, his eyes sunken.

At shelters, the lack of water makes it hard to maintain even basic hygiene, said Dr. Ali al-Uhisi, who treats patients at one in Deir al-Balah. Lice and chicken pox have spread, he said, and on Wednesday morning alone he treated four cases of meningitis. This week, he’s also seen 20 cases of the liver infection hepatitis A.

“What worries me is that I know I’m seeing a fraction of the total number of cases at the shelter,” he said.

For most ailments, there is no treatment — zinc tablets and oral rehydration salts vanished the first week of the war. Frustrated patients have assaulted doctors, said Al-Uhisi, who described being beaten this week by a patient who needed a syringe.

Sadeia Abu Harbeid, 44, said she missed a chemotherapy treatment for her breast cancer during the second week of the war and can’t find painkillers. Without regular treatments, she says, her chances of survival dim.

She hardly eats, choosing to give most of the little food she has to her 2-year-old. “This existence is a humiliation,” she said.

Across Gaza, rare scenes of dissent are playing out. Some Palestinians are openly challenging the authority of Hamas, which long has ruled the enclave with an iron fist. Four Palestinians across Gaza spoke to AP on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals about what they’ve seen.

A man who was told off by a Hamas officer for cutting the bread line took a chair and smashed it over his head, according to an aid worker in line. In another area, angry crowds hurled stones at Hamas police who cut in front of a water line and beat them with their fists until they scattered, according to a journalist there.

Over the past few night in Gaza City, Hamas rockets streaming overhead toward Israel have prompted outbursts of rage from a U.N. shelter. In the middle of the night, hundreds of people have shouted insults against Hamas and cried out that they wanted the war to end, according to a 28-year-old sleeping in a tent there with his family.

And during a televised press conference Tuesday, a young man with a dazed expression and bandaged wrist pushed his way through the crowd, disrupting a speech by Iyad Bozum, spokesman for the Hamas-run Interior Ministry.

“May God hold you to account, Hamas!” the man yelled, shaking his wounded hand.

Gaza’s future remains uncertain as Israeli tanks rumble down the ghostly streets of Gaza City with the goal of toppling Hamas. Palestinians say it will never be the same.

“The Gaza I know is just a memory now,” said 16-year-old Jehad Ghandour, who fled to Rafah. “There are no places or anything I know left.”'",climate,drought

Target: Katie Hobbs, Governor of Arizona

Goal: Stop overheated sidewalks and other public areas from seriously injuring residents.

One of the more underreported effects of the climate crisis is the contact injuries individuals are suffering from even the shortest exposure to overheated surfaces. Arizona’s burn centers, for instance, saw an overwhelming uptick in cases of both adults and children enduring severe injuries from contact with asphalt sidewalks and other searing hot objects over the summer. A wheelchair-bound politician even received burns from temporarily grabbing a railing for assistance.

Asphalt in particular is dangerous when overheated because temperatures can soar to nearly 200 degrees F. And even when the surface touches skin, its sizzling nature remains the same. Bad burns can also affect the nervous system and create serious long-term health repercussions. Houseless people who often sleep or rest on these surfaces face particular risk of harm.

Sign the petition below to urge officials in this state to enact more warnings, public education, and mitigation measures to curtail this serious threat to public health and well-being.

PETITION LETTER:

Dear Governor Hobbs,

In the midst of Arizona’s record-shattering summer heatwave, too many residents (including at-risk houseless individuals) suffered debilitating burns that impacted their health in both the short and long-term. And these injuries came not from fires or flames but from objects the public utilizes every day, such as sidewalks and railings. Citizens of Phoenix especially suffered this fate.

In order to prevent a repeat of this trend when hot weather once again arrives, the state must take action. For one, signs should be clearly posted in asphalt-heavy areas warning of potential harm. In addition, a broader public outreach campaign must be launched so that residents (both housed and unhoused) know how to protect themselves. And investments that could lessen the heat-trapping effect of public venues would be ideal.

Please advocate for and implement any actions that could curb a lingering public health threat.

Sincerely,

[Your Name Here]

"'This story was originally published by St. Louis Public Radio, a BND content partner.

St. Louis City SC opened its first mini-pitch in Fairmont City on Thursday night to a crowd of a few hundred in the Metro East community.

With a hard surface, lighting, walls surrounding the field of play and chain nets, the pitch will serve Fairmont City for a long time, said Mayor Mike Suarez.

“This is just amazing,” he said. “It just makes me smile.”

The Fairmont City mini-pitch is one of 11 planned across the St. Louis area. They are funded by the professional soccer team, American Family Insurance and the U.S. Soccer Federation.

Construction also finished at a small field in DeSoto Park north of downtown St. Louis this month. Next year, City SC will begin construction on a field in Ferguson.

The other locations are still to be determined, said Barbra Silva, City’s director of community relations. She said the remaining eight locations will be announced over the next two years.

“This could be for children. This could be for adults that play pickup soccer,” Silva said. “It doesn’t matter what age you are. It’s just the location for you to be able to play soccer safely and be accessible.”

Silva said there are few additional perks to the new pitch. Maintaining grass takes a lot of work. Because it is a hard surface, it won’t require maintenance, can be played in all kinds of weather and can be used by those in wheelchairs, she said.

From City SC’s vantage point, Silva said the organization hopes the playing surface will help grow the sport in the same way that it’s grown in Europe, South America and Africa, “where soccer is part of the makeup of the community.”

City SC defenders Josh Yaro and Kyle Hiebert, along with midfielder Célio Pompeu, told the crowd they were all jealous of the new pitch.

“If I have those fields, those things in Brazil when I was young, this is nice,” said Pompeu, who goes by his first name, Célio. “This is where the dream starts.”

Brian Munoz/Brian Munoz

Hiebert, a native Canadian, said his neighborhood park had a goal — but no net.

“I had two balls. If I didn’t hit the crossbar, I was running to go chase my ball and come back,” Hiebert said. “So a pitch like this is a privilege, and it’s amazing to see so many kids are taking advantage of that.”

In Fairmont City, a majority Hispanic community of more than 2,000, soccer ties run deep. Suarez said the village started its own youth soccer program in 2015 with 20 participants.

Now, the program has ballooned to 150 players — with some coming from a variety of surrounding communities. With the new pitch and new youth program from City SC on Thursday nights, Suarez expects the demand will only increase.

“There’s going to be kids out here getting the best training that money can buy — and it’s free,” Suarez said.

Nine-year-old Carson Munoz, who was suited up with his 8-year-old friend Connor Wheat, in bright yellow kits, said he approves of the new pitch.

“I like it because I can come here like every day because I don’t live far,” Carson said. “I can just play here with my friends and goof around.”

Connor said he liked the City SC logo on the pitch and the new look. And just like Célio told the crowd earlier, Carson said the new field will help the players practice so they can dream big.

“We’ll go to the MLS, the Premier League, La Liga and then the international cup,” he said with a smile.'",sports,soccer

"'SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (Edited News Release/KY3) - As pickleball grows in popularity around the country, Drury University will add a co-ed team to its 2024-25 non-NCAA sports offerings.

Recruitment for the team is happening. Pickleball, a racket or paddle sport, resembles tennis or table tennis and is played with a hollow plastic ball with paddles over a 34-inch net. It has been the fastest-growing sport in the United States for five consecutive years, with more than 48 million participants having played it in the last year.

In August, Drury announced the construction of an outdoor recreation area, the Panther Pad, that will feature six pickleball courts. The facility, which is one of the first official pickleball courts on a college campus, was designed for intercollegiate competition and will be completed in spring 2024. The space was made possible by the generosity of several members of the O’Reilly family.

“With the addition of pickleball, we are not only expanding our sports offerings but enhancing the overall campus experience,” said Drury President John Beuerlein. “This exciting addition reaffirms Drury’s dedication to providing diverse opportunities for our students, fostering a vibrant campus life and a robust sense of community.”

Jarrod Smith, currently serving as Drury’s men’s and women’s tennis coach head, will transition to head coach of the pickleball program. “I am absolutely elated to be leading a new program at the place I have called home for the past two decades,” said Smith. “We are passionate about the future of the sport and growing it, not only at Drury but everywhere amongst collegiate institutions. The Springfield community has been so supportive of all pickleball endeavors locally, and I know there will be an amazing excitement for this addition to our region.”

Smith has spent more than a decade in pickleball and traveled the country as an instructor and player in professional tournaments, winning national championships in men’s doubles and mixed doubles. Smith has served as Drury’s women’s tennis head coach for 18 years and the men’s head coach for 13 years. He has gone 329-81 in women’s tennis with 16 NCAA-II tournament appearances and eight conference championships. Smith owns a 193-57 mark in men’s tennis with 10 national tournament appearances and three GLVC titles.

“I want to thank Jarrod Smith for embracing this new role with enthusiasm and dedication. We are incredibly fortunate to have one of the nation’s top instructors and advocates for this sport on our campus,” said Drury Vice President and Director of Athletics, Nyla Milleson. “I look forward to the opportunities he will generate and the positive impact the program will have on our students and the entire Drury community.”

“We are the first college program in the country to have a full-time coaching staff, an operational budget and offer scholarships,” Smith pointed out. “The first to put that whole package together.”

Pickleball will be the 13th non-NCAA sport supported by Drury and the institution’s 34th sport under the university’s athletics department. Drury added six club sports (men’s lacrosse, women’s lacrosse, men’s rugby, women’s rugby, men’s hockey, and STUNT) in 2022-23.

“That would have changed so much for me when I was going to school,” said Zach Cosby, whose college days are behind him but still hopes to make it as a professional pickleball player.

“The pandemic did a lot to grow the sport,” he said. “Originally it was a sport tailored towards the older population. I started in the summer of 2019. My girlfriend’s mom was playing and I thought, ‘This is a weird sport and I don’t know if I want to do this.’ It took her over two months to convince me and that first game I just fell in love. I’ve never played a racquet sport before so it was really interesting to me. I did swimming and track in high school but not much in college and this just made me feel active. And getting to play pickleball as a job would be outstanding.”

It’s not too late for Drury junior Andrew Martinez to play college pickleball and he hopes to join the new program next year.

“I’ve been playing for a year-and-a-half now and enjoyed the social opportunities,” he said. “Just seeing how you’re able to connect with other people and how gorgeous the community is that the sports creates is a wonderful thing. My main sport had been soccer but I loved the paddle-hand combo. And I think the program will be a great addition to the school.”

At Springfield’s Meador Park on Monday four members of the Bowles family from Ozark were playing on the pickleball courts representing the growth of the sport among younger people. The senior ages no longer make up the largest age bracket when it comes to those participating in pickleball. That honor now belongs to the 18-34 age group which makes up almost 30 percent of the participants.

The four members of the Bowles family are even younger, ranging in age from 11-15 and while there are now 100 colleges around the country who have a pickleball program, who knows how many there will be by the time they reach college age.

The two oldest Bowles family members playing were 15 year-old Brooklyn and 14 year-old Madison, who both also play school tennis in Ozark. They were joined by their 11 year-old sister Mackenzie and 12 year-old brother Taylor, who both prefer pickleball over tennis while the older sisters prefer tennis.

“It is a hard transition between pickleball and tennis because the games are different,” said Madison. “I prefer tennis.”

“I think I’m better at tennis so I prefer it over pickleball,” Brooklyn added. “Tennis is more like a full-body swing. Pickleball is more like you just punch at the ball.”

“I like pickleball more because you can just jump in at any game and fit in,” countered Taylor.

“Pickleball is fun because you don’t have to hit it with a ton of force,” Mackenzie said. “You just have to hit it a little bit so it doesn’t go out.”

Alma Abazi is a Drury senior who plays for the women’s tennis team but also plays pickleball on occasion.

“The biggest difference to me is the racquet size,” she pointed out. “I struggle with that and air ball a lot of my swings sometimes because I think my racquet is longer than it is. But I understand the popularity of pickleball because it’s a very social sport. It’s easier to learn than tennis.”

And when you consider that one of the other fasting growing activities being added to college programs around the country is e-sports, as in playing video games, pickleball doesn’t seem that weird a choice.

“I think pickleball is an amazing segue way out of the home and back into the outdoors again,” Smith said. “And I think there’s such a focus on technology these days that we’re all guilty of spending too much time on our electronics. “This gives you a chance to get back outside and socialize with your friends.”

“Exercise is really important to us,” Madison Bowles said of her family. “We love sports.”

“And I think pickleball is better than any video game,” Taylor added. “You can play tennis as a video game but it’s not as much fun as getting out here and playing.”

"'MAGOFFIN COUNTY, Ky. (WKYT) - Forest fire season is in full swing in the Bluegrass. Multiple fires burned over the weekend, forcing the Division of Forestry to implement their emergency response plan.

“We had three active fires yesterday, and two of them are still active today that the division of forestry is still out on,” said Fire Chief Paul Howard, Salyersville Fire Department.

While the current weather conditions are conducive to the spreading of forest fires, the Division of Forestry says that 99% of all wildland fires in the state are caused by humans. Over 50% of those fires are attributed to arson, making it the leading cause of forest fires in Kentucky.

Steve Kull, an environmental consultant with the Kentucky Division of Forestry, said arson is “actually defined in statute as setting fire on land owned by another. And it describes, wantonly, maliciously, but basically deliberately causing another person’s land to have a fire.”

We’re told 288 fires this year, so far, have been officially declared as arson. Intentionally setting fire is a felony under state law and is punishable by up to five years in prison or up to $10,000 in fines.

Kull went on to say, “It’s important that we find where it started, then we can move to how it started. Then we can further try to determine if there is footprints or if someone up there is involved or what was used to do it, maybe if they have left something behind.”

With a little over 30 days left in forest fire season, officials are urging folks to abide by the burn bans and make sure any fires are completely out in order to keep folks safe.

“Help us out,” Howard said, “Don’t put fires out that are going to spread and stuff cause you know we got limited resources, and we aren’t able to go everywhere in the spur of the moment.”

“Quicker we find out about a fire, the quicker we can report to it. Hopefully, we have crews available. And report any arson activity you may see,” said Kull.

During our fall fire season, it is illegal to burn anything within 150 feet of any woodland or brushland between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Additional red flag warnings will also be placed for counties at greater risk during fire season.

"'Advertisement Modern earthquakes in US could be aftershocks from quakes in the 1800s, scientists say Share Copy Link Copy

After large earthquakes, there is an expectation that aftershocks could occur in the hours and days that follow, but aftershocks from some of the strongest earthquakes in recorded United States history may still be happening — nearly 200 years later, new research has found.Frequent aftershock activities stemming from a trio of quakes that occurred near the Missouri-Kentucky border between 1811 and 1812, and a separate earthquake in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1886, are likely continuing today, according to a study published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth.In the video player above: Lidar technology uncovers ""geological hazards"" below Yellowstone National ParkOne of the regions researchers focused on, called the New Madrid seismic zone, encompasses present-day Memphis and the surrounding Mid-Mississippi River Valley area, and the other includes Charleston and the surrounding coastal plain. Seismic activity in these relatively stable regions of North America is not well understood, and its nature is debated among scientists, the study authors wrote.""You use the time, distance and the magnitude of event pairs, and try to find the link between two events — that's the idea,"" said lead study author Yuxuan Chen, geoscientist at Wuhan University in China, in a news release. ""If the distance between a pair of earthquakes is closer than expected from background events, then one earthquake is likely the aftershock of the other.""Background events, also known as background seismicity, basically refers to the current rate of seismic activity that's considered normal for a specific region.The researchers found that approximately 30% of all earthquakes from 1980 to 2016 near the Missouri-Kentucky border, all magnitude 2.5 or greater, were likely aftershocks from the three major earthquakes that struck the area in 1811 and 1812, which registered between magnitudes 7.3 and 7.5. In the Charleston area, the findings showed that roughly 16% of the region's modern-day quakes were likely aftershocks from the magnitude 7.0 earthquake of 1886.Identifying whether modern earthquakes are in fact aftershocks of previous large quakes, or are new, unrelated quakes is important for understanding these regions' future disaster risk — even if the newer seismic activity causes little to no damage, the researchers said.Earthquakes vs. aftershocksThe modern seismic activity the researchers studied is likely a mixture of aftershocks from the big quakes from the 1800s and background seismicity, Chen said.""In some respects, the earthquakes look like aftershocks if you look at the spatial distribution, but earthquakes could be tightly clustered for a couple of reasons,"" said Susan Hough, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey who was not involved in the study. ""One is that they're aftershocks, but also you could have a process of creep going on that's not part of an aftershock process. Exactly what their results mean is still open to question.""Another thing to consider when trying to determine whether a quake is an aftershock is how seismically active (or inactive) the region is normally, Hough said.""In an area where small earthquakes are common, it doesn't take as long for aftershock rates to drop below the normal seismic rate,"" Hough said. ""Aftershock sequences in relatively quiet areas could appear to last longer simply because there's less background seismic activity.""Debate on long-lived aftershocksHough coauthored a similar 2014 study using extensive computer modeling to understand activity in the New Madrid seismic zone, and it came to a different conclusion.""Are small earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone aftershocks of 1811-1812 or not?"" Hough said in an email. ""We've looked into it, and it doesn't look consistent with a long-lived aftershock sequence.""She and coauthor Morgan Page, a geophysicist with the USGS Earthquake Science Center, came to the conclusion that the recent tremors were instead new, unrelated earthquakes caused by strain buildup along the New Madrid zone.Because there were no seismographs in this area in the early 1800s, there is no official data recorded from these quakes. The magnitude and impact data that exists was estimated through newspaper reports and personal journals. Using those reports, the USGS has a pretty good record of where the quakes were centered and how widespread the impacts were felt.If the 1811 to 1812 sequence was in fact still causing aftershocks, the area would have seen a certain number of small and moderate quakes during the 19th and 20th centuries, Hough explained.""The new study considers the question from a different angle, considering how tightly clustered earthquakes are, and concluding that some of the events are ongoing aftershocks,"" Hough said. ""The question remains: if New Madrid earthquakes are aftershocks, why don't they follow the rules that aftershocks are known to follow?""The big difficulty with confirming or denying the results of these studies or the long-lived aftershock more broadly is that among seismologists there is no universally agreed-upon definition on what an aftershock of an earthquake is, said John Ebel, a professor of geophysics at Boston College who was not involved in the latest study.""Every seismologist who studies such phenomena has no choice but to make assumptions about how to define foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks,"" said Ebel, who is also a senior research scientist at Boston College's Weston Observatory, in an email. ""Thus, different seismologists will define foreshocks, mainshocks and aftershocks in somewhat different ways, and that makes comparing studies by different investigators subject to uncertainty and disagreement.""For Hough's 2014 study, the researchers considered an aftershock sequence to be over when the rate of earthquakes fell below the rate before the main shock. Aftershocks might still be continuing, but once the normal seismic rate for the area returns, she said, you can no longer identify them as aftershocks.Defining an aftershockIn areas of frequent seismic activity such as California, the aftershocks of a large earthquake last less than a decade, Ebel said. He added this is particularly the case for earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 or greater that have occurred in the past 50 years or so.""Even more to the point, there are no earthquakes that any seismologist would call aftershocks that are currently taking place on the San Andreas Fault in Southern California which last had a big earthquake in 1857 or on the San Andreas Fault in Northern California where the last big earthquake was in 1906,"" Ebel told CNN. ""The San Andreas and other faults in California seem to be behaving differently with respect to aftershocks than are the faults in central and eastern North America.""However, locations away from plate boundaries, such as in Central or Eastern North America, the rate of background earthquakes is very low. Other studies have also speculated that aftershocks in areas away from plate boundaries could last many centuries. The new study just applies another statistical method to reach a similar conclusion, according to Ebel.""Because all such studies rely on statistical analyses, which inherently have some variability in them, these studies cannot answer the questions that they address with complete certainty,"" Ebel said.It would be easier to distinguish this, he explained, if we had thousands of years of earthquake data for both California and Eastern North America.""For this reason, we seismologists sometimes disagree about which earthquakes are foreshocks or aftershocks,"" Ebel said, ""and I think those disagreements are inherently unresolvable.""'",climate,earthquake
"'JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia - Portugal’s Benfica and FC Porto will take part in the first edition of the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, which will be held from June 15 to July 13, 2025, announced the FIFA Council on Sunday in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

FIFA said the 32-team tournament, which will officially be called Mundial de Clubes, would be “harmoniously aligned with the International Match Calendar” to ensure there would be enough of a gap between the final and the start of domestic leagues.

Europe will be represented by 12 teams, including the last four UEFA Champion League winners – England’s Chelsea (2020/21), Spain’s Real Madrid (2021/22), England’s Manchester City (2022/23), and the 2023/24 winner, which is still to be determined.

Germany’s Bayern Munich, France’s Paris Saint-Germain and Italy’s Inter Milan are also confirmed participants.

FIFA also confirmed three of the four CONCACAF representatives – Mexico’s C.F. Monterrey, Seattle Sounders FC and Mexico’s Club Leon.

"'Parts of Cleveland, York, and Chester counties are now under a level 4 out of 5 drought, per the United States Drought Monitor.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Over 7.5 million people in North Carolina are under drought conditions Thursday, according to the United States Drought Monitor updated that morning. In South Carolina, that number is just under 2.5 million.

In the Charlotte area, parts of Cleveland, York, and Chester counties are now under extreme drought conditions, which is considered a level 4 out of 5 on the weekly report. Otherwise, most most of the western Carolinas is under severe drought conditions, or a level 3.

Across the Piedmont region, six to eight inches of rain is needed to get the area out of drought conditions. However, large amounts of rain over a short period of time are also not ideal. Heavy rain can cause flooding. A light-to-moderate amount of rain over a long period of time is ideal for gently refiling water basins.

Drought conditions have led to wildfires across the Carolinas, especially in western North Carolina.

Low humidity, dry brush and vegetation, and light winds will keep the risk elevated until rain returns to the region.

(AP Photo/Daniel Cole, File)

NICE, France (AP) — The French soccer league suspended Nice defender Youcef Atal for seven matches on Wednesday after he shared an antisemitic message on social media.

Nice had already suspended Atal last week until further notice and said that he apologized for his actions. After the matter was reviewed by the French soccer federation’s ethics committee, the French league’s disciplinary commission suspended Atal.

Atal’s suspension comes after the Nice public prosecutor’s office opened a preliminary investigation targeting Atal on charges “of defending terrorism” for sharing the message online. The prosecutor’s office said Atal is also being investigated for “public incitement to hatred or violence because of a particular religion.”

The 27-year-old Atal, who also plays for Algeria’s national team, apologized after reportedly reposting and then deleting a video in which a Palestinian preacher made an antisemitic statement.

Writing on Instagram, Atal said he understood that his post was shocking to some people and said he condemns all forms of violence, “no matter where in the world.”

"'The Cumberland Town Council voted Monday to move forward with plans for a three-building affordable housing complex on Drowne Road.

The vote was 5-1, with Councilor Shirley Storey-King opposed and Councilor Michael Edes absent, to enter into a preliminary agreement with the Westbrook Development Corporation, which has developed housing projects in Westbrook and one in Portland. The nonprofit developer was the sole group to respond to an August request from the town for proposals to fund, build and operate the apartments on Drowne Road.

“Westbrook Development Corporation is developing this project with state and federal funds they feel they can achieve,” Town Manager Bill Shane said.

Related Cumberland seeks proposals for affordable housing project on Drowne Road

A townwide referendum on the project could be held in March.

Plans call for three 3-story buildings that would include 71 one-bedroom apartments, 36 of which would be reserved for seniors, and 21 two- bedroom and 15 three-bedroom units for all ages.

The apartments would be reserved for households earning less than 60% of area’s median income, $49,740 to $70,980 a year depending the number of people in the household. Rents would between $1,332 and $1,845 depending on the size of the apartments.

“We’re an expensive community to live in, and there’s no hiding that,” Shane said. “We have a crisis.”

In 2023, 80 houses were sold in Cumberland, Shane said, and only eight of those were under $400,000, which is considered “affordable” in Cumberland.

“How the heck is anyone going to live here?” he asked.

Residents living near or on Drowne Road said Monday said an increase in traffic resulting from the development is one of their main concerns. The neighborhood is already used as a shortcut to avoid the center of town, they said.

“We’re in favor of affordable housing, but not at this location,” Katherine Pelletreau said.

David Niklaus said he wants to see affordable housing in Cumberland, too, but not at the former Drowne Road Little League fields.

“We’re a walking neighborhood,” Niklaus said. “This is a road where kids learn to ride their bicycles.”

A member of the Affordable Housing Committee, Gail Witherill, said the location was chosen in part because the town already owns the land, making the project less costly.

“The nice thing I’ve heard tonight is everyone supports affordable housing,” resident Ron Bancroft said. “That’s terrific, that must mean that we can move forward.”

The Town Council will hold three meetings with residents at Val Halla in early 2024 to discuss the project in advance of a potential March referendum. The first community meeting is scheduled for Jan. 18.

“No one on this council has anything to gain from approving this project,” Councilor Ronald Copp said. “Let’s let the people in this town vote and tell us it’s a good project or it’s not a good project.”

The council will have more details on the referendum at its Jan. 8 meeting, Shane said Tuesday.

Councilor Shirley Storey-King was the only member to vote against entering into a memorandum of understanding Monday night.

“I’m not against affordability, I just don’t think it’s our problem to solve in this way at this time,” she said.

Westbrook Development Corporation works “in tandem with city officials, civic leaders, neighborhoods, and residents to create housing options of their choice,” according to its website.

"'A 5.1-magnitude earthquake was reported on the Big Island of Hawaii on Monday (December 4), according to the United States Geological Survey.

The earthquake was reported to be felt across the island with 1,100 residents claiming to have felt shaking when it hit at approximately 5:54 p.m. local time. The 5.1-magnitude natural disaster's epicenter was reported to be located at the Kilauea Volcano.

There was no tsunami threat in relation to the earthquake, though additional aftershocks were possible, the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency announced in a post shared on its social media accounts. The initial earthquake and a 3.0-magnitude aftershock were reportedly unrelated to volcanic activity, the USGS's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory confirmed in a statement shared on its website.

"'National champs.

Yeah, Rockhurst soccer likes the ring of that.

The Hawklets were deemed national champions by the United Soccer Coaches (and other entities) after winning the Missouri Class 4 state boys high school soccer title in Fenton last weekend.

Rockhurst (24-0-0) needed some last-second heroics to secure the state championship — the Hawklets’ third in as many years.

After coasting to a 6-0 win over John Burroughs in the semifinals last Friday at World Wide Technology Soccer Park, Rockhurst faced Park Hill South in the title match.

It was tied 1-1 and the match was seemingly headed to overtime. But Teddy Franke corralled a ricochet in front of the Panthers’ goal, then opportunistically toed the ball past the Park Hill South defense for the winning goal with just 5 seconds left.

“I’m so happy for all the seniors,” Hawklets coach Matt Darby said. “The night before, we played a beautiful game and everything was clicking on all cylinders.

“Then Saturday, against a really good Park Hill South team, they threw everything at us and gave us the biggest test we had all year. We found a way to battle through it. It may not have been our best performance, but we had to dig our deepest in that game.”

This week, the day before Thanksgiving, Rockhurst was crowned the national champion by the United Soccer Coaches organization. The Hawklets had a plus-93 goal differential in 2023.

“A lot of people look at it and think its crazy to see a team from KCMO on top,” Rockhurst senior Baka Kante said. “It’s not something we expected going into the season, but (it’s) something to definitely be proud of.”

Senior Brooks Barrett was asked the best part of his career as a Hawklet.

“Three rings, and definitely brotherhood,” he said. “Its been unbelievable.”

Don’t sleep on sleep

We’re t-minus three days from 4:30 p.m. sunsets, and for some, the start of the winter blues.

This upcoming stretch of doom and gloom can do a number on our mental health. So over the next four months, we’ll be sharing the best hacks for beating the winter blues and how you can actually implement them in your day-to-day.

First up: Sleep.

💤 To stay well, you have to sleep well. At least that’s according to Dr. David Mischoulon, director of the MGH Depression Clinical and Research Program. He said that working on better sleep habits is one of his first interventions to help treat depressive tendencies for all the reasons you’d think: Good sleep gives you more energy, improved focus, and even more motivation. And there’s a ton of advice on how to do it “right:” keep a consistent sleep schedule, create an adult bedtime routine (there’s a reason why babies have them!), etc.

🤔 But unless you’re a baby, maintaining those habits ain’t easy. There’s no question that staying on top of the tips above can help you improve your sleep, Mischoulon said. But with demanding work schedules, social lives, and Daylight Savings messing with our daylight hours, they’re hard to implement. One B-Side reader wrote: “I work 12-hour shifts from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. There’s no way I’m waking up at 4:30 a.m. on my days off.” Preach!

⏰ Good news: getting enough sleep is really all you need. In order to see the benefits of a consistent sleep routine, you just need to stick to the basics, Mischoulon said, i.e., get enough hours of sleep on as reasonable of a schedule as you can. Everything else is just gravy. So whether you’re vigilant about going to bed and waking up at the same time, or you need to schedule your Monday classes later because you’ll be up late on the weekends, you’re making a positive change.

😴 And if you mess up a few days, don’t sweat! Our “sleep banks” are pretty resilient, so “sleep debts” can be repaid with a couple days of good sleep, Mischoulon said. For young people especially, just making sure you get enough zzz’s (shoot for seven to eight hours) to be alert and focused throughout the day is the best thing you can do to reap the rewards.

🩺 Everyone is different. If you’re thinking about making a major intervention or have questions, always talk to a doctor.

⚖️ Gov. Healey’s migrant shelter cap can proceed. A lawsuit from a local legal aid group failed to block Healey’s plan to cap the state’s emergency shelter system at 7,500 families due to extremely high demand, limited budget, and not much space. The suit, which was heard Wednesday, argued that Healey’s plan was too abrupt a change to the state’s unique “right-to-shelter” law. But a judge decided in Healey’s favor, clearing the way for the new rules to take effect quickly.

ONE LAST THING

Boston math

You’ve heard about girl math, you’ve heard about boy math, but may we present to you … Boston math.

We made this video detailing some of the key components of Boston math, including carving out 45 minutes for what should be a 30-minute T commute because of slow zones and budgeting over $10,000 for your Sept 1. move to cover the first and last month’s rent, security deposit, and broker’s fee.

This clearly hit home with our IG followers. Many were quick to add their own Boston math equations in the comments, like: “Boston math is trying to get anywhere in the city, it takes $30 and 25 min to Uber, 35 min to T, 40 min to walk. You’re walking,” and “It doesn’t matter if you travel from downtown to Dorchester or somewhere 50 miles away, the travel time is always 45 minutes.”

➗ Thanks for reading! I must be a Boston mathematician, because these have literally all happened to me in the last two months.

💜 Special shoutout to today’s sponsor, the Massachusetts State Treasury, for helping residents reclaim what’s rightfully theirs.

🦃 The results are in: 60% of readers think Nov. 1 is the appropriate time to start playing Christmas music, with one making the compelling point that: “Mariah is fully thawed at this point.”

"'Kim Kardashian is not looking for a new relationship. In the most recent episode of The Kardashians, Kim K revealed that she wants to remain single for another year.

Speaking with celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton, Kardashian revealed that she goes “back and forth” about the possibility of another wedding. After being reminded she would like two years of being single, she agreed that the timeline was accurate.

“So I’ve got a year to go,” Kardashian said. “I think that will be really good for me. Not looking, they seem to find me, but I’m not looking.”

Kim Kardashian is keeping busy with work. In a groundbreaking collaboration, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and SKIMS have announced a multiyear partnership designating SKIMS as the official underwear partner for the NBA, Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), and USA Basketball.

“I am incredibly proud of SKIMS partnership with the NBA, as it is a reflection of SKIMS growing influence on culture,” said Kim Kardashian, Co-Founder & Creative Director, SKIMS. “Together, SKIMS and the NBA will connect people of all backgrounds through fashion, sport, and talent, and I look forward to seeing the partnership thrive.”

“The NBA’s modern approach and significant impact on pop culture, entertainment, and fashion is unparalleled in sports,” said Jens Grede, Co-Founder & CEO, SKIMS. “Our partnership marks a remarkable opportunity for SKIMS and the NBA to work together on what it means to engage the next-generation of fans through basketball.”

“SKIMS has quickly become one of our most culturally-influential brands,” said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. “We look forward to bringing NBA fans and SKIMS users unique experiences, new offerings and premium products through our partnership.”

"'The world's #1 tennis player Novak Djokovic says that he's not against vaccination - he's for people's right to choose for themselves.

Novak Djokovic of Serbia hits a forehand against Daniil Medvedev of Russia (not pictured) in the men's singles final on day fourteen of the 2021 U.S. Open tennis tournament at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York, on Sept. 12, 2021. (Danielle Parhizkaran/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters)

Djokovic, who faced significant backlash for his vaccination status, especially in Australia, told 60 Minutes about the ordeal, saying he was ""basically declared as a villain of the world,"" after refusing to take the Covid-19 vaccine in early 2022. While he initially received a vaccine exemption to play in the Australian Open, public outcry led to Australian immigration minister Alex Hawke revoking his visa, barring him from competition, and then deporting the tennis pro on the grounds that he was a ""high-profile unvaccinated individual"" who could influence public sentiment about vaccination.

""People tried to, you know, declare me as an anti-vax. I'm not anti-vax. Nor I am pro-vax. I'm pro-freedom to choose,"" he said.

NEW - Tennis champion Novak Djokovic: ""I'm not anti-vax. Nor I am pro-vax. I'm pro-freedom to choose.""pic.twitter.com/rqBMsmr3Xj — Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) December 9, 2023

""Most of the world [was] against me. I had that kind of experience on the tennis court with crowds that were not maybe cheering me on. But I never had this particular experience before in my life,"" he continued.

This decision, which led to Djokovic's exclusion from the Australian Open and subsequent U.S. Open, was met with a mix of criticism and support, while the legal battle that ensued raised questions about the role of public figures in influencing health decisions.

Djokovic's lawyers argued that his presence was not a risk to public health and that the visa cancellation could actually fuel anti-vaccination sentiment. However, the court sided with the minister, suggesting Djokovic’s choices could indeed foster anti-vaccination views.

Greg Barns S.C., spokesman for the Australian Lawyers Alliance, described the visa ban as “troubling” in a free society. Yet, the Australian government later overturned the ban, allowing Djokovic to participate in the 2023 Australian Open.

Djokovic made a perfectly reasonable personal health decision that had no impact on the spread of COVID, but because he contradicted the (incorrect) public health/media industrial complex consensus, he was declared a villain



One of the most embarrassing time periods in history https://t.co/tlpRxZv2Yb — Ian Miller (@ianmSC) December 11, 2023

Amidst this controversy, a broader conversation emerged about vaccinating athletes. A letter by cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough and structural biologist Panagis Polykretis revealed a startling number of cardiac arrests and major medical issues in vaccinated athletes, raising concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in high-performance sports.

""Important reminder that Djokovic has NEVER said he was against vaccines. He even confirmed that he had all the vaccines as a child but when it came to the brand new Covid vaccine he was an advocate of freedom of choice and that everyone should be free to make their own decisions,"" said Pavvy G, a tennis blogger, in a Dec. 9 post on X, the Epoch Times reports.

Moderna, a key player in vaccine development, reportedly placed Djokovic on a ""vaccine misinformation"" watch list. His victory at the Moderna-sponsored U.S. Open was seen by some as a challenge to vaccine mandates, with social media users highlighting the irony of his unvaccinated status in a tournament sponsored by a leading vaccine manufacturer.

The pharma company claimed that unvaccinated people were celebrating his win, with social media users “mockingly” pointing out that Moderna was the sponsor of the competition. The firm said that the “optics of Djokovic” bolster “anti-vaccine claims that vaccines—and mandates—are unnecessary.” -Epoch Times

"'For the 40th consecutive year, Turner Sports will broadcast live NBA games when the 2023-24 regular season tips off on TNT.

This season has no shortage of storylines. Can LeBron, playing in his 20th NBA campaign, make another championship run with the Lakers and cement his GOAT status? Can Victor Wembenyama, the latest generational talent to enter the NBA, make an impact during his very first season with the Spurs? Most of all: Can any team do anything to slow down the juggernaut triple-double machine that is Nikola Jokic?

The NBA schedule is looking a little bit different than usual this season with the addition of the new in-season tournament that will take place during the 2023 part of the calendar. The tournament will start with group play--games will take place on Tuesdays and Fridays, with TNT getting the Tuesday games and ESPN getting the Friday ones. Once the brackets are set with the winners for each group, the whole quarterfinals round, along with one of the two semifinal games, will air on TNT, with the title game on ABC.

Watch NFL football live with a digital HDTV antenna

Amazon

If you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.

Anyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).

This amplified digital antenna can receive hundreds of HD TV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, FOX, Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It received signals 360 degrees and delivers a high-quality picture in 4K, UHD and 1080 HDTV, top-tier sound and features a 16-foot digital coax cable. This Amazon best selling antenna is usually sells for about $23, though we've seen it priced as low as $15.

If you want to catch this game on your phone -- and all the amazing football ahead this season -- check out NFL+. The premium streaming service, starting at $40 per year (or $7 per month), offers access to NFL Network. And yes, that includes games being broadcast out-of-market.

Storylines we're following this season

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

Taylor Swift's NFL era: As the end of the 2023 NFL regular season nears, it's clear the biggest story of the 2023 NFL season was Taylor Swift (Travie Kelce, too). Swift's appearances at NFL stadiums including Lambeau, Gillette and Arrowhead sent Swifties of all ages into a frenzy that nearly overwhelmed the league itself. Football purists found the intrusion and Swift-related attention unnerving, but the pop sensation brought millions of new fans to the game. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be going strong, which means fans can expect to see Taylor herself in the stands of Kansas City Chiefs games as her schedule allows. Football fans may find it slightly annoying. But if the attention (and new audience) Taylor brought to professional NFL football just by showing up wasn't proof enough, it's Taylor's world and we're all just living in it -- one era at a time.

Is this the Cowboys year? Being a Dallas Cowboys fan requires a Texas-sized emotional commitment. Last season, fans gutted through quarterback Dak Prescott's winning record (not in a good way) of most interceptions thrown in the 2022-2023 season. Dak whittled his interceptions down this season and the Cowboys managed the unthinkable -- they toppled the mighty Philadelphia Eagles from their perch atop the NFC East in Week 14. But the Cowboys' 31-10 upset loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15 is the kind of play that makes Cowboys fans weary. The Cowboys could go all the way to the Super Bowl this season, but it won't be without taking Cowboys fans on an emotional rollercoaster best left at an amusement park.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years has been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket and this season is no different. Lamar is poised to have the best seasons of his career. MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. The Ravens might not get the hype of the Chiefs or Eagles, but they're establishing themselves a Super Bowl contender and Lamar is already making a case to turn those MVP chants into reality. If you don't mind being called a ""bandwagon"" by the teenager in your life, there's never been a better time to jump on the Ravens bandwagon. We won't tell and neither should you.'",sports,football

"'The road to the Super Bowl often comes with a few bumps. And then there’s the one Paramount Global is devising.

The entertainment conglomerate, parent of CBS, which will broadcast Super Bowl LVIII from Las Vegas on February 11, 2024, will construct a “Paramount Mountain” (above, pictured: artist’s rendering) atop the popular Mirage Volcano at The Mirage at 3400 South Las Vegas Blvd in Las Vegas. The display will feature a “Paramount+ Lodge” and an ersatz gondola ride that will offer interactive fan experiences built around Paramount properties including “Transformers,” “Yellowstone,” “Star Trek, “Dora The Explorer,” “Ghosts,” “Sistas” and “UEFA Champions League.” The site will operate for four days, starting Thursday, February 8 and continuing through the Sunday Super Bowl game.

“Paramount’s ‘Mountain of Entertainment’ in Las Vegas is an exciting, fan-focused physical manifestation of the expansive and popular content from across our portfolio of brands,” said Josh Line, executive vice president and chief brand officer, Paramount Global, in a statement. “Our partnership with the NFL allows us to drive growth and engagement with our brands and creates the opportunity to display the power of Paramount’s broad and beloved hits across every genre at the biggest event in television: Super Bowl LVIII.”

The Super Bowl generates millions of advertising dollars, but many of the media companies that are part of the event’s broadcast rotation like to use the spectacular to generate publicity for operations other than a sports division. The network hosting the show usually brings many of its news personnel to the game site, and often uses the broadcast as a launching pad for a new series that executives believe has good prospects for broader consumption. Promos aired during the game may highlight everything from a network’s morning show to new offerings from its streaming hub.

Fox, which broadcast Super Bowl LVII earlier this year, secured about $600 million from the event, according to remarks made by Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corp.’s CEO, during an investor call in February.

Paramount has reason to seek wider publicity. The company will offer a Super Bowl simulcast on Nickelodeon geared toward kids and families. And the company is facing investor scrutiny in the age of streaming, like many of its rivals, as Wall Street presses media companies to show new profit from their efforts to reach consumers via broadband.

The company will begin promoting the mountain experience on Friday, when it marks 100 days leading up to Super Bowl LVIII. The Friday broadcast of “CBS Mornings” will feature 100 Paramount Mountaineers in New York’s Times Square, all of whom will travel across the U.S. and ultimately plant NFL team flags at the base of the new Paramount Mountain.

“CBS’ excitement for Super Bowl LVIII cannot be overstated – for television’s biggest and most-watched event of the year and the opportunity to showcase Paramount’s broad and diverse content offerings in fresh and innovative ways,” said Mike Benson, president and chief marketing officer, CBS, in a statement. “Our efforts launched hours after last February’s Super Bowl with our CBS Sports’ ‘We Can’t Wait’ campaign, and as we prepare to commemorate the 100-day marker – and beyond – we’re continuing to harness the power of CBS and Paramount to attract a massive audience, across television and streaming, to what already promises to be another extraordinary cultural moment.”'",sports,soccer

“You want to play at a high level. But then family is a lot. My son is 16 and then two girls. So, [I’m] looking forward to seeing them grow up in those important years.”

The former University of Arizona standout was traded to the Denver Nuggets on August 10, 2021 and spent one season with the franchise before signing with the Golden State Warriors in July 2013 during the first of his two stints with the franchise.

Watch NFL football live with a digital HDTV antenna

Amazon

If you're cutting the cord to your cable company, you're not alone; in fact, you are in luck. You can still watch the NFL on TV with an affordable indoor antenna, which pulls in local over-the-air HDYC channels such as CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, PBS, Univision and more. Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.

But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch college football without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable (or your cable company gets in a squabble with a network).

This amplified indoor HDTV antenna claims to have a 250-mile range and comes with a 16.5-foot coaxial cable. It's rated 4.0 stars by Amazon reviewers. Regularly $33, it's currently on sale for $22 after coupon ahead of Black Friday.

No. 8 Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson Getty Images

The NFL's first Black Friday game: The league is going big on Thanksgiving this year with three games, followed by its first-ever Black Friday game. Though schedulers had undoubtedly anticipated a bigger matchup between the Dolphins and the Jets prior to Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers suffering a season ending injury during the team's first game of the 2023 season, the NFL still has high hopes that extending its coverage into Black Friday will also extend the ratings.

Hello, my name is Joshua Dobbs. If you follow the Cleveland Browns, you'll recall the team's training camp backup quarterback was 28-year-old journeyman QB Joshua Dobbs. The Browns traded Dobbs to the Arizona Cardinals in August, where he served as the team's starter while franchise QB Kyler Murray rehabbed from injury. On October 31, Dobbs was traded to the Minnesota Vikings. Six days later, he was on the field after the Vikings starter left the game with a concussion. Dobbs led the Vikings to a win over the Atlanta Falcons despite having not practiced with, or learned the names of, his teammates. Dobbs became the first quarterback in NFL history with consecutive three-touchdown games for different teams and continues to start for the Vikings.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years have been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket, but pundits (and Bengals fans) like to argue that Lamar runs the ball too often. The Ravens are 8-3 coming into Week 12 and MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. Jackson has five rushing touchdowns this season, which has no doubt fueled the fire.

The fire department hosts several family-friendly themes at the open house, including giveaways, food, bounce houses, and more. Additionally, residents will see fire prevention demonstrations and can tour the fire station.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) chose this year’s Fire Prevention Week theme: cooking safety. This includes all the critical actions people should take in the kitchen to prevent burns and house fires.

According to NFPA, cooking is the leading cause of home fires and home fire injuries in the US. Unattended cooking is the leading cause of cooking fires and deaths.

These cooking-related home fires often peak during Thanksgiving and Christmas. Ranges or cooktops were central in 61% of reported home cooking fires. They cause 87% of cooking fire deaths and 78% of fire injuries. Also, homes with electric ranges have a higher risk of cooking fires than those with gas ranges.

“Year after year, cooking remains the leading cause of home fires by far, accounting for half (49%) of all U.S. home fires,” Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy at NFPA, said in a press release.

“These numbers tell us there is still much work to do to better educate the public about ways to stay safe when cooking.”

“As I’ve gotten older, it’s a tremendous honor to reach out and give back and it brings me joy to bring joy to others,” he said on the team's website.

First handed out in 1970, the award was renamed Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award in 1999 in honor of the late star Chicago Bears running back.

Obviously, Celtics fans were incredibly happy at the outcome, though many others were pointing out that Boston has been favored several times recently only to come up short. Denver fans were especially miffed as the reigning champs didn't even make the Finals, giving them no chance to defend their title. However, the biggest response has been to the revelation that SGA won MVP. The 25-year-old Canadian is coming off his first All-Star season, so many think this might be a little too much too soon from NBA 2K24. That said, the Thunder are a young squad that's starting to come into its own, so who knows?

Either way, it's important to remember that this is all just for fun. While NBA 2K24 does a decent job of replicating NBA basketball, it's impossible to predict who will actually win until they step onto the court. If you're interested in doing your own NBA 2K24 simulation, the game is available now on PlayStation, Switch, Xbox, and PC platforms.'",sports,basketball
"'One of Tom Brady's former New England Patriots teammates is calling on the franchise to sign the retired seven-time Super Bowl champion amid its quarterback woes.

Former Patriots cornerback Asante Samuel Sr. once again praised Brady while throwing shade at his former head coach, Bill Belichick, after New England's 38-0 loss to the New Orleans Saints on Sunday (October 8), which dropped the team to 1-4 through its first five games.

""This terrible team that everybody sees is a terrible team. He can come right now, today, and win a Super Bowl for the New England Patriots. Because that's Tom Brady,"" Samuel told TMZ Sports on Monday (October 9).

""I compare this team to the 2015 Super Bowl champions,"" Samuel added. ""I see the same exact team -- it's only minus Tom Brady is the difference. And I can see Tom coming and leading this to the Super Bowl.""

Starting quarterback Mac Jones was benched for backup Bailey Zappe for late in the Patriots' blowout loss for the second consecutive week. Jones, a former first-round draft pick, threw for 110 yards and two interceptions on 12 of 22 passing on Sunday.

Samuel, who played alongside Brady and under Belichick in New England during his first five NFL seasons (2003-07), has publicly denounced his former coach numerous times since Brady signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020.

""I don't understand why is it such a big drop off when one man leaves the 53-man roster -- why is it such a big dropoff and you can't replace it but you're supposed to be a great coach?"" Samuel told TMZ Sports.

In July, Samuel reignited his apparent longstanding apparent feud with Belichick when asked by former NFL cornerback and current CBS Sports reporter Bryant McFadden if the 71-year-old was the best coach in NFL history.'",sports,football

Research from the University of Warwick has found that national parks and protected areas are at a higher risk of forest fires when located farther away from indigenous communities.

Based on the analysis of satellite images from Thailand and case studies from other Southeast Asian countries, the research demonstrates that policymakers can achieve improvements in forest health by working collaboratively with indigenous communities. Involving communities results in reduction of forest fires and air pollution.

Ivo Vlaev, Professor of Behavioral Science at Warwick Business School at the University of Warwick says that current green policies in Thailand do not take into account that indigenous communities have long-standing traditions and sustainable practices for protecting the land.

""Globally, Indigenous peoples' lands cover over 36% of intact forest landscapes, making them crucial for mitigating severe climate change. We also know that the loss of intact forest landscapes has been significantly lower on indigenous lands compared to other areas.

""Current green policies exclude local communities from using the forest and at the same time prevents them from implementing effective environmental management practices, such as community forestry, tree ordination (a symbolic Buddhist ritual which involves wrapping orange robes to help people view them as sacred and therefore prevent logging and deforestation), forest fire monitoring, and animal grazing—all of which have been proven to protect forest cover.""

The Mae Sa Noi village in the Chiang Mai highlands in Thailand is home to a Hmong community. The villagers have successfully instilled ancient Hmong rituals which involve annual celebrations for a deity believed to be inhabiting the sacred tong seng tree in the forest.

Co-author of the research, Dr. Marco J Haenssgen from Chiang Mai University, Thailand is in close contact with the community through his work. He says, ""The purpose of these celebrations is to strengthen the protection of the forest while also showcasing the community's commitment to the natural environment to the local authorities who are also invited to these events.""

The Hmong community has experienced competition for natural resources after the state promoted rural development initiatives in order to diversify agriculture away from opium production in the 1960s. Subsequently, stringent forest protection enforcement led to arrests and fines throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

""After experiencing these conditions for many years, the community is facing widespread outmigration of young people, volatility of agricultural markets, and even challenges around food security,"" continues Dr. Haenssgen.

Thai conservation law currently stands in contrast to the global policy direction that aims to support indigenous livelihoods and preserve terrestrial areas. Some policies meant to prevent deforestation actually have the opposite effect by displacing indigenous people and pushing them into more intensive land use, such as cash-cropping which sees continuous cultivation of crops using harmful chemical fertilizers.

""Policymakers need to recognize the value strong communities play in healthy environments and communities need space and the right to thrive sustainably,"" says Professor Vlaev.

""It's not just about giving indigenous people a fair share of the economy, it is about implementing green policies which are actually effective. Several countries have successfully worked with indigenous communities to develop inclusive conservation policies.""

Countries such as Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Norway and Malaysia have involved communities in policy decision-making and achieved sustainable outcomes while respecting indigenous rights.

Recommendations for inclusive forest conservation policies

Academics say Thailand can learn lessons from the experiences of other countries and set out a series of practical recommendations to develop effective sustainable policies and enhance forest conservation:

Implement flexible laws and regulations that consider the specific needs and aspirations of Indigenous communities. The Royal Forestry Department holds the responsibility to create designated zones where Indigenous peoples have the right to manage and utilize forest resources following their traditional practices. This area may extend further into national park territory than presently. Providing a legal framework for Indigenous communities to assert their rights over ancestral lands and resources can also contribute to sustainable forest management.

Establish collaborative arrangements involving local communities to co-care for forest land. Involving indigenous communities in forest fire prevention, waste collection, and other activities will enhance their sense of ownership and motivation to protect and conserve the forest.

Ensure land protection rights and secure tenure for Indigenous communities. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security play key roles in strengthening measures to safeguard these rights and address land conflicts. Additionally, establishing social insurance schemes and promoting welfare benefits can improve the social and economic well-being of Indigenous communities, reducing pressure on agricultural production.

Thailand can encourage consumers to support highland communities by labeling products sourced from them, produced under culturally protected and sustainable indigenous practices. The Thai Food and Drug Administration ensures compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, supporting sustainable production methods and quality. The Royal Project Foundation, a major agricultural-environmental development organization, can also support food labeling as a market-based initiative. ""No-burn"" labels can be used to signify that this agriculturist has not practiced crop burning that is responsible for air pollution.

Thailand should streamline and expedite the process of issuing land titles to recognize their customary land rights, to join the rest of the world in recognizing the capabilities of Indigenous people.

The Ministries of Culture, Interior, Social development and Human Development have a central role in promoting cultural diversity and enforcing Indigenous cultural freedom, thereby helping Thailand expand the special cultural zones that provide legal protection and recognition for Indigenous cultures and traditions. These zones should be designed to preserve and promote Indigenous languages, knowledge systems, and cultural practices, yet with a focus on everyday heritage rather than locking communities into ""traditions"" that are bound to evolve.'",climate,heatwave
"'Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr announced Wednesday that three men were facing a combined 52-count indictment resulting from a state anti-gang operation.

Operation Heatwave, which was underway for 16 weeks, led to 96 arrests, according to the AG’s office.

Through the effort, 62 guns were recovered and 41 suspected gang members were apprehended, officials said.

Now, three of the 96 defendants face an indictment in Fulton County court. Carr’s office said they faced charges for drug trafficking and weapons offenses.

[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]

Carr’s office said the three individuals indicted were alleged to have participated in criminal gang activity while associated with the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips.

“Chiquille Bell, Contrellis Books, and Marcus Thornton with Violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act, Trafficking Oxycodone, Possession with Intent to Distribute Amphetamine, Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony, and other drug and weapons offenses,” the AG’s office said in the announcement.

The AG’s office continued, saying the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips were a “traditional street gang based in Los Angeles, California.”

TRENDING STORIES:

“This indictment is further proof of the results we’re able to achieve when all levels of law enforcement come together to do one thing – protect the people of our state,” Carr said. “With Operation Heatwave, we continue to see meaningful outcomes that ultimately lead to safer streets and safer communities, and we’re proud to be a part of this effort alongside our partners at APD. When it comes to violent crime and gang activity, we will not look the other way, and those responsible will be held accountable.”

Bell, Books and Thornton were indicted after the AG’s office presented evidence to a Fulton County Grand Jury on Aug. 31.

Prosecutors from the Attorney General’s Gang Prosecution Unit will handle the case, according to the AG’s office.

The defendants named in the indictment face the following charges.

Chiquille Bell (aka Santana), 28, of Atlanta:

13 counts of Violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act

2 counts of Trafficking Oxycodone

1 count of Trafficking Amphetamine

1 count of Trafficking Marijuana

2 counts of Possession with Intent to Distribute Psilocybin Mushrooms

2 counts of Possession with Intent to Distribute Alprazolam (Xanax)

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Amphetamine

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana

1 count of Deliver, Distribute, Dispense, and Sell MDMA

1 count of Deliver, Distribute, Dispense, and Sell Marijuana

2 counts of Possession of Drug Related Objects

7 counts of Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon

7 counts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony

1 count of Theft by Receiving Stolen Property

1 count of False Report of a Crime

Contrellis Brooks (aka 1600 Pablo), 33, of Atlanta:

3 counts of Violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act

1 count of Trafficking Oxycodone

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Psilocybin Mushrooms

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Alprazolam (Xanax)

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Amphetamine

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana

1 count of Possession of Drug Related Objects

5 counts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony

Marcus Thornton, 34, of Atlanta:

3 counts of Violation of the Street Gang Terrorism and Prevention Act

1 count of Trafficking Oxycodone

1 count of Possession with Intent to Distribute Amphetamine

2 counts of Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of a Felony

Since its creation in July 2022, the Gang Prosecution Unit has indicted 89 alleged gang members across Georgia.

Operation Heatwave, according to Carr’s announcement, reduced violent crimes in the st ate by as much as 40%, depending on the crime in question.

In the city of Atlanta, the AG said crime was down 21%, with homicide down 26%, aggravated assaults down 21%, and robberies down 19%.

“The Operation Heatwave detail is a partnership that spans our federal, state, and local partners, focused on attacking gangs, guns and drugs,” Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. “Operation Heatwave is an intelligence-driven initiative that is successful because we identify which individuals are likely to commit violent crimes in our city. Data allows us to identify what areas of the city are prone to violence. Our key partnerships, coupled with the hard work from our sworn and civilian personnel, is how we go after the gangs, guns, and drugs that drive violent crime and how we are able to protect the residents, visitors and stakeholders of the city and the county.”

Across the state, the multi-agency operation has reportedly reduced homicides by 24%, aggravated assaults by 11%, and robberies by 40%, according to Carr’s office.

To further advance its commitment to sustainable operations, Oracle and its asset recovery partners recycled 99.7 percent of retired hardware they collected in FY'23.

Customers and Partners Welcome the New Oracle Cloud Valparaíso Region

""The cloud is transforming the way we work and deliver services to our customers. For us it is essential to have business partners who are constantly evolving in this sense and have a strong local presence,"" said Esteban Kemp, COO, Banco de Chile. ""The opening of a second Oracle Cloud region in Chile, in addition to providing scalable, flexible, and secure services, will provide us with greater resilience via local access – which is necessary to support the digital transformation of Banco de Chile.""

""When we considered completely vacating our data centers and migrating them to OCI, we had planned to do so within a period of 12 months and with the support of the Oracle team,"" said Sergio Cornejo, chief technology officer, Unicomer. ""We managed to migrate 18 data centers in eight months, exceeding the expectations set. The process has been successful and has allowed us to reduce service times in our stores, especially during periods of high demand such as Christmas.""

""Given that in Chile the rise of cloud infrastructure is a reality, the arrival of Oracle's second region not only marks a technological milestone, but it will also help drive digital transformation and new cloud architectures that are more resilient and secure for industries across the country,"" said Helder Branco, head of IT operations, Entel. ""In addition, the opening of this new region demonstrates Oracle's commitment to the country and continues to enable local companies to use world-class solutions recognized for their stability and high performance.""

""We see the opening of a new Oracle Cloud region in Chile as an important step forward towards greater resilience, low latency, and high availability, which allows us to continue trusting Oracle as a technological ally to leverage our growth and development in LATAM,"" said Emilio Davis, CTO and founder, Khipu.

"'By Eurasia Review

Despite steps toward decreasing deforestation, uncontrolled wildfires are threatening environmental gains in Brazilian Amazonia, one of the world’s most critical carbon sinks and a region of high biological and cultural diversity.

An international team of scientists are raising the alarm in a letter published today in Nature Ecology & Evolution. ‘Increasing wildfires threaten progress on halting deforestation in Brazilian Amazonia’ is co-authored by researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) and the University of South Alabama, which led the study. Other contributors include Michigan State University, the National Institute for Space Research in Brazil and other institutions in North America, South America and Europe.

In June 2023, the number of active fires in the Amazon reached the highest peak since 2007. Total fire counts for the first half of 2023 were 10 per cent higher than in 2022.

Dr Matthew Jones, a Reseach Fellow in UEA’s School of Environmental Sciences and a co-author of the letter, said: “Climate change has led to a rise in drought and extreme heat, priming forests to burn more often.

“On top of this, deforestation and the expansion of agriculture have damaged the integrity of the region’s forests and weakened their resilience to drought.

“As a result, wildfires have become far more common than they would be in a normally functioning rainforest.”

Previous spikes in fire counts, including the record-breaking fires for a non-drought year in August and September 2022, were associated with widespread deforestation, a primary source of fire and a strong predictor of burned area.

Deforestation rates have been falling in 2023, with alerts 42 per cent lower between January and July than in the same period of 2022. Environmental gains in the region also include the closure of major illegal mining operations that threaten the ecosystem and Indigenous communities, particularly in Yanomami territory.

Dr. Gabriel de Oliveira, an assistant professor at the University of South Alabama, is the lead author of the letter.

Dr de Oliveira said: “This year’s high and climbing fire counts, in the context of reduced deforestation, highlight a decoupling of forest fires from deforestation. “Indeed, only 19 per cent of the fires were related to recent deforestation during January-June 2023, down from 39 per cent in 2022.”

Hotter and drier climate conditions resulting from the 2023 El Niño are already impacting portions of the Amazon and may be increasing fires, consistent with prior El Niños, the researchers said.

Additional pressures may be affecting fire counts, including the lag effect of the deforestation boom associated with weakened enforcement of environmental laws under President Bolsonaro. Some areas of forest that were mechanically felled in recent years are only now becoming dry enough to burn.

Also, landholders may be burning pastures earlier in the dry season in anticipation of a fire moratorium later this year, expected under the return of stronger environmental governance of President Lula in the context of a strong El Nino linked drought.

Dr Rachel Carmenta, a lecturer in climate change and international development at UEA and a co-author, said: “Effective and equitable fire governance is essential in order to avoid further marginalizing forest-dependent peoples who are both most heavily impacted when uncontrolled fires invade the forests upon which they depend, and most impacted by one-size-fits-all fire policy such as fire-bans.”

Indigenous groups have been using fire in their agriculture over millennia but have not experienced megafires like today. The current situation is driven by large-scale actors, climate change and forest fragmentation.

Dr Carmenta said: “The role of distant consumers is huge. But the small traditional communities are often blamed, representing a double burden because they also suffer the most when invasive fires damage the forest, leaving it without the game, fruits, timber, medicines and resources they depend on.

“Identifying ways to manage these fires is essential in order to avoid further marginalizing forest-dependent peoples who are most heavily impacted when uncontrolled fires invade their territories, and most impacted by one-size-fits-all fire policy such as fire bans.”

Dr Scott Stark, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, is a co-author of the letter. He said: “While research is needed to better understand the comparative contributions of these drivers, a clear expectation is that fire incidence will rise even higher with the anticipated drier conditions over coming months.”

Dr de Oliveira said: “Nuanced science and management actions, including reforestation, forest management and agroforestry will be necessary to avert the risk of ‘runaway’ forest fire and degradation that is decoupled from deforestation.”

The authors are calling for strong, equitable and coordinated international efforts to tackle this growing threat.

In August, Brazil convened a summit of Amazon nations to address sustainable development and forest preservation in the region.

The summit’s resulting Belém Declaration established many important objectives, but it fell short of a strong commitment to achieving zero deforestation by 2030 or to substantially reducing forest fire frequency.

However, the declaration established an important alliance against deforestation, acknowledging fire as a point of concern, highlighting the needs of Indigenous Peoples and traditional local communities, and introducing a scientific body in the style of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) aiming to produce evidence-based Amazon specific solutions.

“Brazil, other Amazon nations and the international community must cooperate and commit the support needed to rapidly advance research and governance for equitable fire-safe land management, while curbing forest loss and shifting from a commodity-based economic model to a sustainable bioeconomy that benefits all Amazonians and Amazon nations,” the authors said.

"'The SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles may be one of the most advanced stadiums in the world, but drama is now surrounding it regarding the FIFA World Cup in 2026, and it may be because of owner Stan Kroenke.

When FIFA announced that the US, Mexico, and Canada would have joint-hosting duties in 2026, SoFi Stadium became one of the frontrunners to hold the final match. However, the Daily Mail reported that it is ""now at high risk of not hosting a single game of the event.""

ESPN Deportes' John Sutcliffe noted, ""A source told me that they are 90 percent sure that SoFi Stadium, the most expensive stadium in the world, has a design problem."" This apparently made Kroenke, who owns current NBA champions the Denver Nuggets and English Premier League team Arsenal, unhappy.

Despite being one of the biggest sports stadiums on the planet, FIFA officials reportedly found that its field is not wide enough to accommodate a soccer pitch for an official tournament game. It was then suggested to the Arsenal owner that the ""private boxes or sections of the stands would have to be removed to widen the space around the field to accommodate a soccer pitch."" However, Kroenke was having none of it.

Sutcliffe noted, ""It had design problems, no one told Mr. Kroenke that they didn't plan for a soccer field and that it has to get rid of these boxes. The information that I have is that SoFi Stadium is no longer going to be a World Cup venue because the stadium's owner [Kroenke] said, 'For what it is going to cost me, best skip it.'""

This means that the $5 billion stadium might not host any games at all as FIFA found the pitch to be too small and that its owner is unwilling to make changes. The Los Angeles venue has now gone from possibly hosting the most-watched game in the world to not being able to host a single game at all.

Should Los Angeles lose its hosting rights if SoFi Stadium's owner remains adamant about not making changes, FIFA actually has several contingencies. According to World Soccer Talk, Las Vegas may be in the running as a replacement host city.

Much like SoFi, the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas is also brand new and is a state-of-the-art NFL arena. However, it should be noted that this is not final yet.

New York and Dallas Final Contenders to Hold FIFA World Cup 2026 Instead of Los Angeles

The SoFi Stadium drama has left only two contenders to host possibly the most-watched game in the world, and they are New York and Dallas.

According to The Mirror, the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final hosting rights battle now boils down to the MetLife Stadium in New York and the AT&T Arena in Dallas, Texas. Both are world-class stadiums, though Dallas is currently the frontrunner now that Los Angeles may be out of the picture.

"'What effects do droughts have now that crops have been harvested?

Central Indiana is currently grappling with moderate drought conditions in the southern half of the state. As the region typically experiences colder temperatures, precipitation deficits have raised concerns about potential ramifications on various sectors.

Even with the rain we received last night, we’re expected to see these drought conditions continue into next week and beyond. Most of the rain was off north anyways where drought conditions aren’t as drastic.

Impacts

The impact of winter drought conditions can be far-reaching, affecting both the environment and the local communities. One of the most immediate consequences is the strain on water resources. Lakes, rivers, and reservoirs that typically replenish during winter months are experiencing reduced water levels. This not only affects water availability for households but also poses challenges for agricultural irrigation, which heavily relies on adequate water supplies.

Furthermore, the agricultural sector is facing significant setbacks. Winter drought conditions can hinder soil moisture levels, making it difficult for farmers to prepare their fields for spring planting. Prolonged drought may also delay the germination and growth of winter crops, leading to reduced yields and potential financial losses.

Droughts can even cause invisible damage initially to plants. When the ground gets very cold, roots can become exposed to the air and this can cause damage to the plants nutrient intake.

Beyond agriculture, the drought’s impact extends to ecosystems and wildlife. Central Indiana’s flora and fauna rely on winter precipitation to support essential processes such as hibernation, migration, and food availability. A lack of moisture can disrupt these natural cycles, potentially leading to imbalances and impacting biodiversity.

Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of winter drought, local authorities and communities are taking proactive measures. Water conservation campaigns are being promoted, encouraging residents to minimize water usage and adopt sustainable practices. Farmers are exploring alternative irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation, to optimize water usage.'",climate,drought

The severe water shortage in Caney, Kansas forces changes for the rest of the semester in the Caney school district.

Beginning Monday, Oct. 30, the district will move to a four-day school week to limit water use in schools. With over half of Caney students living outside the Caney city limits, Superintendent Blake Vargas says that will greatly help the water situation, but will not hurt students academically

"'According to the National Weather Service (NWS), areas of Miami-Dade and Broward are under a flood watch until Thursday morning.

The Miami-Dade Department of Emergency Management (DEM) is offering tips to keep your community safe amid these conditions.

You can protect your home from flooding by moving valuables inside and moving electrical appliances above flood levels.

The DEM also emphasizes that it's not safe to drive or walk into flood water.

Get South Florida local news, weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox. Sign up for NBC South Florida newsletters.

Residents are urged to never drive or walk around road barriers or through any large puddles, as hidden debris could sit under the surface -- which could hurt you or disable your vehicle.

If you are driving and come across a flooded road, DEM says you should turn around, as more than half of the deaths from flooding each year occur in vehicles.

The department also says to not underestimate the power of water -- as six inches of fast-moving flood water can knock over an adult. It takes just 12 inches of rushing water to carry away a small car, while two feet of rushing water can carry away most vehicles.

Stay away from downed power lines and electrical wires as electrocution is another major killer in floods, according to Miami Dade's DEM.

Electrical current can travel through water and downed power lines should be reported to Florida Power and Light's customer service number at (305) 442-8770.'",climate,flood
"'Credit: The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz

Amid his ongoing lawsuit against the NFL for retaliation and wrongful termination, Jim Trotter joined The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz on Wednesday and described a previously unpublicized “ambush” by NFL Media executives against him and Steve Wyche over their podcast, Huddle and Flow.

In 2018, Trotter and Wyche approached their bosses asking to do a podcast “from the perspective of two Black men covering the NFL.” Executives from the media arm never responded, so it “died on a vine,” according to Trotter.

Two years later as America was dominated by conversations around racial justice, NFL Media changed its tune. Trotter and Wyche got a green light for the show.

Trotter was hesitant at first. But eventually, he and Wyche agreed the show could make an impact, so they decided to launch it.

With six weeks left in the NFL season, Intuit TurboTax approached NFL Media wanting to sponsor the show. Trotter asked for details and ultimately found out Intuit was prepared to pay $250,000 for a six-week sponsorship.

Trotter, Wyche and their producer convened and determined they would ask for a slice of that money.

“We’re putting together the show. We’re doing everything. We book our own guests. We do our own research,” Trotter explained. “The only thing the NFL does is take a link we give them and put it on some sort of social media site.”

So they met with an NFL Media executive overseeing audio and made their request. That’s when the “ambush” came.

“All of a sudden, there are five or six people, none of whom look like us, all of whom are in management. Two of whom were the top two people at the NFL Media crew,” Trotter said. “Mind you, we didn’t ask to meet with any of these people.”

Because they had gotten ahead of their skis and taken ownership over their work, Trotter felt the show of force was purposeful. By then, he had already butted heads with management over the NFL’s diversity efforts.

“I’m feeling like we’ve just been ambushed,” Trotter explained. “And we are told by (NFL VP of Creative) David Jurenka that ‘we’re not paying you for a podcast, we don’t pay for podcasts, not happening.'”

Huddle and Flow ended after that first season run.

Trotter now works for The Athletic and is in a protracted legal battle with the league over incidents like this.

"'I have never met UCLA’s John Wooden, the Green Bay Packers’ late Vince Lombardi, the New England Patriots’ coach Bill Belichick, or even recently retired former Red Sox coach Terry Francona. I have, though, met a local legend: the great Fran Smith. He is known most recently for having coached his 500th high school football game. I say it’s a perfect record, half century of dedicating your free time for the betterment of others.

If Coach Smith can boast of a 500-0 record, why is his name not known the way the previous mentioned were? My guess is because he never needed the recognition. The people worth bragging about don’t do it themselves. On my porch today are Little League team photos from 1993 and 1994. In both you see Coach Fran standing behind his rocket-armed son Aaron, and me with an arm only second to his, in front of my mother Robyn wearing a fanny pack. My mom retired after a first-place instructional league finish, but Fran continued his coaching path for decades across three sports. His son and I became good friends growing up, and reunited playing together on the diamond over 20 years later.

Go into his house and before you have even sit down, it’s clear this ranch on the north end of Westfield is a true sports house. Steelers memorabilia and signed footballs that would make any sports collector jealous. For those who don’t get it, they might see sport of any kind as entertainment only. Have Coach Smith pencil you to bat leadoff, lace up your Nikes and run the point in basketball, or his favorite, put on the pads and put one hand in the dirt and play football. Then you tell me sports are just for entertainment.'",sports,baseball
"'A University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa research team presented their ideas to improve fire-resistant gear currently on the market for firefighters to NASA experts who study fire shelters that are deployed during forest fire emergency situations.

Led by Shu-Hwa Lin from the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources’ ( CTAHR ) Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, Fashion Design and Merchandising program, the team presented their innovations during NASA ’s Minority University Research and Education Project Innovation and Tech Transfer Idea Competition ( MITTIC ) held at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, from November 29 to December 1.

The team, called Inferno Tech, consists of UH Mānoa students: team leader Chester Leoso, Matthew Kirimitsu, Johnathan Hollis, Alexander Castillo, Johnell Ladera, Jason Merlander, Louis Jeffers-Fabro and Rio Chappot. They are the first Hawaiʻi group to participate in the federal space agency’s contest, and competed against nine other university teams across the country.

MITTIC is similar to Shark Tank, where, in front of Space Tank Judges (business coaches), students were given the #SpaceToPitch their innovative ideas for new technologies that can benefit their campus, community and the world. MITTIC offers monetary awards for selected teams, with the winning team receiving $20,000 and the second team receiving $10,000. Additionally, students receive better opportunities for MITTIC internships.

Although the team did not receive the winning prizes, they received inspiration and motivation to make changes in their community.

“It was inspiring to see so many people at NASA working hard to make changes in the world. Each change may be small, but make a significant difference for all of mankind,” said Kirimitsu, the team’s manager of public affairs. “That is why NASA needs university students to start making these changes to impact their generation. We want to eventually start working with other accelerators and competitions here in Hawaiʻi to start a movement of entrepreneurship here at UH Mānoa.”

The opportunity to make a change

Firefighting is associated with various cancers, as they work in and around dangerous environments and carcinogens. In addition, fire suits typically contain perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as PFAS , or forever chemicals, which are toxic to humans.

“We are researching sustainable materials that can be manufactured to create chemical-free turnout gear for firefighters,” said Kirimitsu. “We hope to take our research to the next level by collaborating with NASA to get feedback, and be an inspiration to other UH Mānoa students who want to start their careers with NASA .”

After interviewing local firefighters, the team concluded that fire personal protective equipment desperately needs to change, and they felt obligated to create a solution that could maintain firefighters’ long-term health.

“Firefighters deserve protection that keeps them safe from fires, as well as later illnesses that can result from being a firefighter. It can [also] help protect our community from toxic chemicals that are released in high-danger environments,” Kirimitsu said. “Fires are not going away anytime soon, and we want to keep our firefighters and our ʻohana safe. NASA is allowing us an opportunity to make a change, and I am excited to meet some of these highly intelligent individuals.”'",climate,forest fire

Drought-prone California OKs new rules for turning wastewater directly into drinking water https://t.co/FYB1aDcZp4 — The Associated Press (@AP) December 19, 2023

Due to water scarcity, the state was already previously using recycled water for decades, but such recycled water usage stopped short of becoming drinking water, The AP reported.

“Water is so precious in California. It is important that we use it more than once,” Jennifer West, managing director of WateReuse California, said, according to the outlet.

The recycled drinking water would be zealously treated for pathogens to ensure quality drinkable water, The AP reported.

“It’s at the same drinking water quality, and probably better in many instances,” said Darrin Polhemus, deputy director of the division of drinking water for the California Water Resources Control Board, according to The AP.

The State of Colorado adopted a similar measure back in Oct. 2022, making it the first state in the U.S. to do so, The AP reported. The California regulatory decision requires water agencies let their customers know before they start directly recycling their wastewater, according to The AP. Water agencies in Los Angeles and San Diego have already planned pilot programs to start this process, ABC7 reported.

The ranking isn’t particularly surprising. The Mystics were in the playoffs last year and had the potential to contend for a championship if multiple player injuries didn’t happen at once. Assuming they bring everyone back, starting with Elena Delle Donne, the Mystics can be dark horse contenders once again.

Of course, Washington is also a dark horse contender at best. The Las Vegas Aces just won their second straight championship and the New York Liberty are right behind them. It will be difficult to see the Mystics be outright championship contenders without some “help” in the form of injuries to those teams, the Sun and Wings, while the Mystics keep their core and add another major free agent in the process.

"'HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - While Kilauea isn’t erupting just yet, volcanologists say increased seismic activity continues to be detected in the area.

The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reports a tremor being measured nearly island-wide on Monday from approximately 2:20 p.m. to 3 p.m.

The activity was the strongest at Kilauea’s summit caldera.

No eruption just yet, but two trails at Kilauea closed amid increase rumbling

U.S. Geological Survey officials say an eruption is possible in the coming weeks or months.

They say inflation at the summit is currently higher than when Kilauea erupted last month.

If there is a new eruption, it’s believed to once again be contained in the summit region, safely away from any infrastructure.

Small amounts of vog can be seen seeping out from Kilauea’s summit but it has no significant impacts to the environment at this time.

Due to elevated seismic activity and inflation at the summit of Kīlauea volcano, Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park is temporarily closing specific trails, viewing areas, and parking lots until further notice.

Advertisement Phillies take Game 1 in the NL Championship Series Share Copy Link Copy

Bryce Harper smashed the first pitch he saw on his 31st birthday into the seats, Kyle Schwarber hit his first homer of the postseason and Nick Castellanos also went deep again to power the Philadelphia Phillies past the Arizona Diamondbacks 5-3 in Game 1 of the NL Championship Series on Monday night.Harper held up three fingers on his left hand and one on his right and pretended to blow them out like candles on a cake as he crossed the plate. Harper, who also walked, scored twice and knocked in two runs, hit his 10th homer in two postseasons with the Phillies.Zack Wheeler struck out eight in six innings to help the defending National League champions win their seventh Game 1 of the last two postseasons. Wheeler sawed two bats in half during the first two innings, leaving the Diamondbacks with more pieces of busted lumber than hits through five.José Alvarado got four big outs on 15 pitches and Craig Kimbrel worked a scoreless ninth for the save.Arizona was stuck with its first loss of the postseason after ripping off five straight wins against the Brewers and Dodgers.The Diamondbacks were simply the latest team to unravel under the red storm of 45,396 towel-waving, deliriously-cheering fans at Citizens Bank Park. The Phillies never gave fans a reason to stop — or a chance for Arizona to catch its breath until it was too late.Schwarber started the home run derby when he launched Zac Gallen's first pitch 420 feet into the right-field seats.

"'(Beirut) – FIFA and Qatar have failed in the past year to remedy abuses of migrant workers who made the 2022 Qatar World Cup possible, including families of thousands of migrant workers who died of unexplained causes, Human Rights Watch said today. The 2022 World Cup tournament may be over for much of the world, including FIFA, but the legacy of the tournament lingers on for victims in Qatar and across migrant origin countries.



“FIFA’s answer to addressing the terrible human rights legacy it left behind in Qatar should have been to provide remedy for migrant deaths and stolen wages,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “By failing to do so, FIFA is showing disdain for the very workers who made the World Cup possible.”



Before the 2022 tournament, Qatari authorities and FIFA made grossly inaccurate and misleading claims that Qatar’s labor protection systems and compensation mechanisms were adequate to remedy these widespread abuses.



Human Rights Watch research has shown that Qatar’s labor reforms, made under intense global scrutiny, were extremely limited due to their late introduction, narrow scope, or poor enforcement, and that scores of migrant workers fell through the cracks. After the global spotlight on Qatar’s abuses dimmed, abused migrant workers and families of the deceased faced old and new forms of exploitation that Human Rights Watch documented in the post-2022 World Cup slowdown and that continue today.



FIFA’s irresponsible abandonment of migrant workers in Qatar and Qatar’s poor enforcement of reforms meant that many of the workers remain in Qatar in the post-tournament slowdown without work or pay and with outstanding wages and benefits contractually owed to them. Human Rights Watch documented that they are unable to return to their home countries as they fear that they would not be able to access the stolen wages and justice they are due from overseas.



A Qatar-based migrant worker said his company, dealing with a business slowdown, now is sending workers home for long, unpaid leaves. “The workers are given QAR 1000 and airfare and told they will be contacted when there is work,” he said.



This leaves workers in a quandary, unable to quit as they are owed end-of-service benefits for over 10-15 years. These benefits add up to a significant amount that would go a long way back in their home countries. One worker said the extended leave policies leave workers without pay for months while the hope of future opportunities is dangled before them. The worker said that many migrant workers believe it is a way for companies to avoid paying end-of-service benefits.



Meanwhile, Qatar’s labor court has continued to be very slow in adjudicating outstanding cases brought by migrant workers who were cheated out of their wages or end-of-service benefits pre- and post-World Cup. Human Rights Watch has also spoken to workers who have been hesitant to file cases. “Even when the court rules in favor of workers companies don’t obey court orders and pay workers what they are owed,” a worker said. “In this context, I don’t have the motivation to fight a legal battle.”



Some migrant workers have attempted to sue companies in jurisdictions outside Qatar. Forty Filipino migrant workers recently filed a in the US state of Colorado against Jacobs Solutions Inc., a US firm that oversaw construction projects for four World Cup stadiums, for multiple alleged abuses, including unpaid wages, cramped living conditions, passport confiscation, and working in extreme heat. Fourteen of the Filipino workers worked for Al Jaber, a company in which, according to the lawsuit, Jacobs Solutions Inc. played a role “to monitor, direct, and control the labor supply chain.”



In an October statement to Quartz, Jacobs Solutions responded that they had not received or reviewed the lawsuit in detail, but emphasized their commitment to “respecting human rights and dignity.”



In 2022, Human Rights Watch reported that Al Jaber had hired workers under short-term project visas that forced them to return home before the end of their two-year contracts. The workers had paid exorbitant recruitment fees up to $1,570, but Al Jaber denied claims that workers paid recruitment fees in their response to Human Rights Watch.



In October 2023, two former Al Jaber workers told Human Rights Watch that the loans obtained to pay recruitment fees are still outstanding. One worker who was sent back after 10 months in Qatar said, “I do odd jobs now. My ten months in Qatar was a waste because I paid more than what I had earned.”



FIFA and Qatari authorities had an opportunity to address some of these bitter legacies by providing a remedy, including financial compensation, Human Rights Watch said. They could have built upon and expanded the limited successes of Qatar’s Workers’ Support Fund by reimbursing some migrant workers.



As one of the beneficiaries of the fund told Human Rights Watch, “When I got a call unexpectedly to come pick up my check after months of following up, I could not believe it.” He immediately transferred the money to his family, who had taken loans for his children’s education and parents’ health bills.



Other limited positive examples in Qatar that addressed migrant worker abuses include the Universal Reimbursement Scheme by the Supreme Committee, the body responsible for planning and delivering World Cup infrastructure, under which workers were reimbursed for recruitment fees. Some companies adopted programs that compensated families of deceased migrant workers regardless of the cause or location of the worker’s death.



Unfortunately, only a handful of companies adopted such programs. For example, only 23 Supreme Committee companies adopted life insurance for their migrant workers.



FIFA and Qatar decided not to transform these small positive initiatives into a wider legacy of the 2022 World Cup for migrant workers. The call for remedy in the leadup to the tournament received strong global backing from football associations, sponsors, and politicians. In the months before the 2022 World Cup opened, FIFA indicated in a series of statements and briefings that it planned to compensate workers, such as at the Council of Europe hearing on labor rights in Qatar and to the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Working Group on Workers’ Rights in Qatar.



But on the eve of the 2022 tournament, FIFA President Gianni Infantino responded to remedy calls for workers by claiming that the Qatar Labor Ministry’s Workers Support and Insurance Fund would take care of compensation, which it has failed to do. Migrants’ realities of fighting for wages since the World Cup closed show that FIFA’s pledges were blatant falsehoods, and much of the abuses were predictable and preventable.



A son of a deceased Qatar-based construction worker told Human Rights Watch: “My father used to support the family financially, and now it is only me. My mother is getting older, and I have a newborn expenses are rising. It is very difficult to take care of my family alone.”



FIFA appears to be repeating the serious errors it made during the 12-year preparation for the 2022 World Cup, Human Rights Watch said. FIFA has effectively awarded the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia, a country that relies extensively on over 13.4 million migrant workers, many of whom come from the same countries as Qatar’s workers.



“Many families are left in the dark about what killed their loved ones or how to afford the next day’s meal,” Page said. “FIFA and Qatari authorities continue to deflect scrutiny from their abject failure of protecting workers rather than spending a modicum of effort to compensate the very workers who generated huge revenues for them.”

PERTH, Australia (AP) — A wildfire burning out of control on the outskirts of the Australian west coast city of Perth on Thursday destroyed at least two homes and injured two people, officials said.

An emergency warning was issued for the eastern suburb of Parkerville where the fire was sparked by a tree branch falling on power lines on Thursday morning. The alert warned that the fire posed a threat to lives and homes.

At least two homes had been ""completely lost,” Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said.

The full extent of the damage wouldn't be known until inspection crews were able to survey the fire zone.

Two men in their 60s were hospitalized after being injured by the fire in separate incidents, media reported. One had minor burns and the other an injured foot. The ambulance service didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Fire authorities reported late Thursday that the fire had been contained but remained out of control after razing 90 hectares (220 acres).

One of the destroyed homes belonged to Mark Norton who lives near where the fire started and had little time to escape.

“The fire was on both sides: really, really hot,"" Norton told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""It was an awful experience.”

“The fire was still the height of the trees when I left. How they (firefighters) managed to contain that in such a short period of time in 39-degree (Celsius; 102 F) heat with this wind — they’re amazing, they really are,"" Norton added.

Power was off at more than 150 properties and several roads had been cut off.

Parkerville resident Yvonne Blyth said that her car was packed with her children’s Christmas gifts in case the family had to evacuate their home, which is located in a forest. The fire had come close but appeared to be moving away from her home of 18 years, she said.

“We’ve seen three or four fires now, but this was the closest one,” Blyth said.

“We all love living in the forest, but this is the scariest part of living around here. It’s absolutely terrifying,” Blyth added.'",climate,heatwave

"'How do you bring back a vanishing coral reef? That’s what conservationists are racing to do in the Florida Keys, where they’re coming up with a whole new playbook for saving corals.

Over the summer, they did what used to be the unthinkable: they took thousands of corals out of sea-based nurseries to save them from a killer ocean heatwave. Hot tub-like temperatures might have wiped them out otherwise. Now, what’s next?

The Verge visited the evacuated corals where they found temporary refuge on land. We spent time at a gene bank, home to a new generation of baby corals that could one day repopulate Florida’s reefs. And we learned how to map restoration efforts out in the open ocean.

It’s all part of a massive effort to safeguard a future for coral reefs on which thousands of other species and people depend. And, it turns out, the rescuers are already preparing for next summer. After all, temperatures keep rising with climate change, stressing reefs that have already suffered huge losses. That’s why conservationists have to keep pushing the envelope.

"'AEW Continental Classic Report, Collision 12/9/2023

The first-ever Continental Classic resumed with two Blue League tournament matches on ""AEW Collision"" taped in Montreal, Quebec.

In the opening match of the program, current Ring of Honor and New Japan Strong Openweight Champion Eddie Kingston squared off against long-time rival Claudio Castagnoli. The last time the two met was at the Grand Slam special of ""AEW Dynamite"" in September. On that night, Kingston captured the ROH World Championship. Castagnoli started off the rematch on the offensive looking to ensure there wasn't a repeat of the September result. Unfortunately for Castagnoli, he was once again bested by Kingston who earned his first three points in the tournament. The finish came after a powerbomb attempt by Kingston was reversed by Castagnoli, who then saw his reversal also reversed by Kingston for the three count.

In the main event, Bryan Danielson wrestled Andrade El Idolo. Both men were undefeated in tournament action coming into the bout. Danielson, who will soon be retiring from full-time competition, wrestled twice in as many nights. Last night, Danielson defeated Daniel Garcia on ""Rampage."" Tonight, he wasn't so lucky losing to Andrade El Idolo in a closely-contested bout, which featured El Idolo opening a cut around Danielson's eye. In the end, El Idolo hit a Flatliner hammerlock DDT to earn the three points, tying him with Danielson and Brody King to lead the Blue League. After the match, El Idolo showed concern for Danielson, but was confronted by Claudio Castagnoli who arrived on the scene and promptly told El Idolo to leave.

The Continental Classic continues with three Gold League matches on Wednesday night. The special Winter is Coming edition of ""AEW Dynamite"" features Rush taking on Jay Lethal, Swerve Strickland wrestling Jon Moxley, and Mark Briscoe going to battle with Jay White.'",sports,tennis
"'A high tide and big waves kept first responders busy Thursday morning at the Oceano Dunes.

Personnel with State Parks and CAL FIRE SLO worked to evacuate campers in the area due to the high water levels.

A family of five also had to be rescued when their vehicle was swept into the waves.

""The car was making its way back into town. They were coming from the camping area and crossing the creek,"" said CAL FIRE SLO Battalion Chief Paul Provence.

A rescue swimmer helped pull the four adults and one child out of the car to safety. They were reportedly taken to a local hospital to be treated for potential hypothermia.

Water rescues were reported up and down the Central Coast, from surf rescues at Spooner's Cove, a cliff rescue at Pirate's Cove, and surf rescues in southern Santa Barbara County.

The strong waves and high tide also caused problems in Port San Luis.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — With leaves and temperatures falling across the region, concern over wildfires is hanging around. Five counties in Central Pennsylvania: Cumberland, Franklin, Perry, Juniata, and Mifflin, were placed under a high wildfire risk.

""We’ve gone several weeks now in November without much precipitation,"" Mike Kern, the chief forest fire warden for the PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) – Bureau of Forestry.

The lack of rainfall has left the Susquehanna Valley facing dry conditions. To mitigate that, the DCNR is executing prescribed fires, also known as “controlled burns.""

""We can keep the intensity down, [wildfires] don't do as much damage,"" Kern said. ""We’re basically trying to burn the forested areas or what we call the fuels.""

Fuels refers to the dead leaves, dead branches, and anything dry on the state forests' floors and and throughout county parks.

This can also have benefits to specific vegetation across the state, with controlled burns helping species adapted to fires.

""For example, if you want to promote oak regeneration or plant oak trees in an area, you can actually use fire to do that,"" Kern said.

""In Pennsylvania, humans cause almost 99% of the wildfires,"" Kern said. ""If you’re burning, have a cleared area around the area you’re burning. Keep a rake and a shovel handy, some water, so you can put the fire out when you’re done with it.""

"'A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

As far back as last winter, the odds were on two talent-heavy teams to go to the WNBA finals, and the predictions came true. Last year's champs, the Las Vegas Aces, take on the New York Liberty in Game 1 Sunday in Las Vegas. And joining us now is basketball analyst Terrika Foster-Brasby. All right. So, Terrika, both teams have been called super teams. Explain what that means. Why are these two teams super teams?

TERRIKA FOSTER-BRASBY: Yeah. Well, both teams have been given this name simply because of the roster that they have constructed. Now, one team, the New York Liberty, acquired these players via trades in this off season. So they have multiple players that have multiple MVP's, players that have been nominated - or named as, you know, all-stars and also about four players that have won WNBA championships. Same thing with the Las Vegas Aces, except their team was a little bit more put together through the draft, where they also have a team that's filled with multiple all-stars. They acquired a WNBA legend, Candace Parker, in this off season, Alysha Clark as well. And so these two teams have been the powerhouse of the WNBA this entire season.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, the two top records in the WNBA, too. All right. So let's focus in on the matchup of the two stars of this series - the Aces' A'ja Wilson versus the Liberty's Breanna Stewart, each in the prime of their careers. They're both really, really good. What do you expect to see against them in the finals? And might they guard each other?

FOSTER-BRASBY: Pure dominance is what you're probably going to see from both of them. I mean, Breanna Stewart, she was named the most valuable player of the 2023 WNBA season. And so she has set the record books on fire this year for multiple 40-point games, which is something that we had never seen before. For a little while, she held the scoring record this year. We expect to see her just continue to lead her team in domination. The good thing about the New York Liberty is that because they have so many stars on their team, Breanna doesn't have to do it all. There are multiple players who have the ability to support her when she has had some offensive struggles this postseason.

Oppositely, A'ja Wilson just continues to play like a woman possessed. She's had multiple 30-plus games in the postseason alone, which is something that no one else had ever done before in the history of the WNBA, which is in its 27th postseason. And she's been leading her team throughout some of - gosh - some of the more difficult matchups. I don't think that they will guard each other...

MARTÍNEZ: Ugh.

FOSTER-BRASBY: ...That much.

MARTÍNEZ: Oh, oh.

FOSTER-BRASBY: Jonquel Jones usually guards A'ja Wilson. However, the way that their size matches up...

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah.

FOSTER-BRASBY: ...On the inside inside, you can probably see that there will be times where Breanna and A'ja will go toe to toe.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah, just a couple of times. Clear out one side of the floor and let them go at it.

FOSTER-BRASBY: That's it.

MARTÍNEZ: Why not? That'd be awesome. You know, the NBA in the early '80s was not the league that it is today. But then along came Magic Johnson and the Lakers and Larry Bird and the Celtics, and their championship rivalries just took the league to another level. It was fascinating. It's still talked about today. Can this be that? Can this be the thing that takes the WNBA to that next level, these two super teams and these two stars going at it for five games?

FOSTER-BRASBY: Yeah. I actually think that that's a very great comparison. And here's why. The WNBA no longer has conference alignment when it comes to the playoffs. So it's not like an East versus West like in the NBA. It's the top eight teams, regardless of conference, who make the postseason. It just so happens this year that the two teams who are going to be vying for a championship is the top team in the East and the top team in the West. So you're kind of starting to see at least that East Coast-West Coast rivalry with these two teams. But certainly because of the ability of A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart to really impact the way this league is marketed, the way this league is seen, you can absolutely think that these - this rivalry could be something brewing for years to come.

MARTÍNEZ: Basketball analyst Terrika Foster-Brasby, thanks a lot.

FOSTER-BRASBY: Thank you.

"'If Donald Trump is reelected to the White House next year, it will happen not only because of ardent “Always Trumpers,” but because of another group of voters: the “Always Republicans.”

Many people always and only vote for candidates of their own party. But if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee in next year’s presidential election, it would be a good time for people who always vote for Republicans to make a different choice.

I am truly worried that a return of Trump to the White House will fundamentally change the nature of our constitutional republic for the worse, and possibly even destroy it.

As former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyoming, told PBS “NewsHour” earlier this month, Trump would “put people around him who are willing to help him do what he failed to do last time” — which was to try to subvert democracy to stay in power, even after losing a legitimate and fair election. As Cheney observed, that’s “a very grave threat.”

It’s not as though I don’t see many problems with President Joe Biden and some of his policies. But those issues fall in the realm of debatable policy within normal political parameters, and they are things that can be fixed — they are not existential threats to our country.

So, when I read my friend Keith Vogt’s declaration in the Dec. 3 Sunday LNP | LancasterOnline Perspective section (“A local conservative’s view of the looming 2024 election”) that he plans to vote for Trump again for president, despite Trump’s many flaws, it made me wonder: What, if anything, would cause a person like Keith not to vote for a Republican? How bad does it need to get? How much more fundamentally does the Republican Party have to change for voters like Keith to see that the party is no longer conservative in any meaningful way?

The GOP is beholden to one man whose only platform is to exact retribution on anyone who crosses him and, according to his own words, rule like a dictator and suspend the Constitution if he deems it necessary. Revenge, retribution, retaliation: These are the ruinous precursors of violent revolutions. A conservative, by definition, is not a revolutionary.

I decided to talk to another Lancaster County friend, someone who followed a similar path as I did some years ago in leaving the Republican Party. His name is Patrick Gerlach.

Patrick became a Democrat in 2015 and is a district leader for the local party now. I became an independent in 2016 and have assisted both Democrats and Republicans ever since. Patrick and I got to know each other this year on a campaign, and found out we had a lot in common. I invited Patrick to join me in this column in the format of a conversation. (It has been edited for newspaper style and clarity.)

— Ann Womble

Womble: Patrick, I’ve told everyone the basics above, but would you describe your political journey in more depth?

Gerlach: I was raised in a staunchly Republican family on the (Philadelphia) Main Line and my first involvement in a campaign was working for the election of John McCain in the 2000 presidential primary against George W. Bush. I honestly thought that John McCain was the better candidate and of higher moral character.

Bush v. Gore (the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that controversially settled the 2000 presidential election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore), 9/11 and finally the 2003 invasion of Iraq all combined to make me start to reevaluate my political leanings. Also during these years I was very involved with my church and I watched as people started to combine their patriotic love of country with their religion. It struck me at the time as somewhat twisted and misguided, so even church life began to feel like a garment that no longer fit.

I was pleased with the election of Barack Obama (in 2008) because it heralded the best of America and I was honestly shocked to hear folks refer to him with a racial slur. Then came Donald Trump, intent on “exposing” Obama as illegitimate and not a “real American” with false claims he was born in another country. When Trump was rewarded with the GOP nomination for president in 2016 ... that sent me over the edge! He was a TV personality who had never been elected to any position of public trust. Those were his main claims to fame.

I switched parties and worked to get Hillary Clinton elected. I was not super-enthusiastic about her candidacy because I did not feel that power should pass from the king to the queen, but I decided it was better than electing a political neophyte. But Donald Trump won the 2016 election fair and square, and Clinton gave a gracious concession speech several days later, something that President Trump did not do after he lost to Joe Biden four years later.

Womble: We share similar backgrounds in the Christian faith. Why do you think so many Christians are drawn to Trump, a man so manifestly immoral and power-hungry? Nothing could be further from the fruits of the spirit of Jesus’ teachings or the qualities we were taught to admire and expect in leaders.

Gerlach: Ann, that is a confounding question. I honestly cannot understand because all through the Bill Clinton years what we heard constantly was how disgusting his behavior was, and how it was a stain on the presidency.

Womble: I consider myself a conservative in the traditional sense. Do you?

Gerlach: If we are talking about the real definition of the word “conservative” — to conserve — then, yes. To me, a conservative believes in fiscal responsibility, strong defense, the international rules-based order, capitalism, free trade and especially the rule of law. It also means to conserve farmland and to protect God’s magnificent Earth and to look out for those less fortunate, which is a central tenet of the Christian Gospel.

Womble: That brings me to another question. I see a streak of cruelty — or at least a comfort level with cruelty — now in the Republican Party that I didn’t see before. I attribute a lot of it to the accommodation of Trump. For example, there’s an almost heartlessness about how to deal with immigrants and refugees. To me, it’s completely at odds with the pro-life ethic of defending the most vulnerable among us. What do you think?

Gerlach: To bring this issue close to home, one of the most wonderful attributes of our Lancaster County ethos is seen in organizations like Church World Service and the welcome and support we give to refugees. Lancaster County residents know how to do this better than anyone. We put Matthew 25:35-40 into practice (“For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in ...”). I will never understand how devout Christians can support wanton cruelty such as separating children from parents at the border. This policy was done on purpose.

Womble: In many ways, the extremists in both parties think and act alike. For example, they encourage a victimhood mindset over individual responsibility, or use identity politics to divide people. Do you see these similarities? It’s the horseshoe theory — the extremes are actually closer to each other in both positions and tactics than they are to the broad center.

Gerlach: Of course. Each side engages in the very thing that they accuse the other of doing. During the protests in response to George Floyd’s murder in 2020, the left erupted into violence in some cities, yet the right equally erupted into violence on Jan. 6, 2021, when summoned by Trump to Washington, D.C., after he tweeted “Be there, will be wild!” We are on a dangerous path if it becomes acceptable for either side to engage in violence to achieve its ends. Another conservative thought: The ends do not justify the means.

Womble: I want to see an alliance to stop Trump in 2024. Maybe it would have to be a temporary alliance, like animals fleeing a forest fire. To get out of danger and save their lives, predators and prey suspend the natural order of things for a while and work toward the same goal. This would require enough “Always Republicans” to overcome their natural instinct to reflexively vote for the letter after a candidate’s name, and to vote instead to save the republic from a larger danger. How can we work together to accomplish it?

Gerlach: Wow. Work together? Red and blue? How about we all strive to be purple for the sake of the republic in 2024? Because otherwise, we are cooked. Are there things that we all can agree on? Red and blue, believer and doubter? A Venn diagram for America? We all want to be understood and valued for our uniqueness as individuals. We want to live free. Free from hunger and free from violence. We want a bright future for our children and we want to grow old with dignity. This list could be expanded, but you get my point.

Womble: I like that — a Venn diagram for America. What unites us has to be stronger than what divides us. If we can avert this immediate threat, there will be plenty of future elections to argue and compromise about policies, reforms and new political realignments. When I changed my voter registration, I stopped feeling forced to cheer for only one team and started to cheer more for the preservation of the big, consequential game itself — our American democracy.

Gerlach: For the past several elections when knocking on the doors of voters, I was often accosted with, “Are you a Republican or a Democrat?”

My reply is always, “I am an American, just like you.” That always elicits an agreeable smile, and then we have a good conversation, regardless of their party. Most people understand that this angry screaming match hurts everyone, and they wish it would stop.

Womble: There was so much more Patrick and I explored in our conversation that I wish I could convey here. We strongly agreed on the need for Americans to unite in 2024 to reclaim our democracy from the allure of dangerous, strongmen-style politicians like Trump.

To the “Always Republican” voters out there prepared to once again vote for Trump, I ask you: What happens when the next president after Trump, perhaps a Democrat, gets elected, flush with the juiced-up dictatorial powers a second Trump presidency might provide? Maybe then, but maybe too late, we would agree that wise constraints such as constitutional order and the rule of law are more important than preferred policy outcomes.

"'Helping your kids with homework is such a special bonding experience — in theory. But in reality? It can be frustrating, stressful, and/or just plain boring. If you’ve ever felt that way (I definitely have!), then Serena Williams has the perfect trick for making it more fun — and her daughter can’t even tell the difference.

The 23-time Grand Slam champion shared a new video of the hilarious homework trick she does with her 6-year-old daughter Olympia, who she shares with husband Alexis Ohanian. As the retired tennis player pumps breastmilk for her 3-month-old daughter Adira, she goes over Olympia’s spelling words with the most interesting definition sentences.

“Pumping for baby while teaching Olympia how to spell… how do you like my sentences?” she captioned a recent video on TikTok. Williams is dressed in a black tank top and gold “mama” necklace as she pumps and goes over Olympia’s spelling list. The first word is “this,” which Williams explains: “This right here, is my swag,” she says with a straight face.

The next word is “they.” “They gon’ get it,” she tells her daughter, who doesn’t seem to react at all, just works on the task at hand.

Other funny definition sentences include “She gotta good shape” for the word “shape,” and “where you learn how to twerk from?” for the word “from.” How she delivers these lines without even smiling is beyond me — I can’t stop laughing at the sheer creativity. You gotta entertain yourself somehow when going through the mundane tasks you’re your kids, right?

People were loving Williams’ approach to spelling homework. “The fact that Olympia isn’t questioning these sentences tells me everything I need to know about this household, 😂” one person quipped.

"'From Fisherman’s Wharf to Oracle Park, where the Giants play baseball, San Francisco wants to build a 30-foot wall to prevent a rising bay from submerging this low-lying edge of the city.

The 7.5-mile wall is expected to cost $13 billion. It would be the largest public works project in an expensive city’s storied history. And it’s just the tip of the proverbial iceberg for the Bay Area.

Opinion

Managing flood in the Central Valley comes with the territory and is a perennial work in progress, with some regions better off than others. The Valley has grown accustomed to being the big kid on the block when it comes to flood protection needs. It is, after all, where the rivers of the western Sierra can rage before reaching San Francisco Bay. We have happened to decide to occupy lands throughout the floodplain, including the state Capitol itself.

Now, however, the Bay Area has to worry about floods coming from the Bay through a cruel combination of sea level rise and peak storm surge. Its needs are exploding — financially overwhelming those of Sacramento and the Central Valley.

A study earlier this year by the Bay Delta and Development Commission identified $110 billion in infrastructure needs to adapt to sea level rise. The flood control strategies for the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Watersheds devised by the Central Valley Flood Protection Board, meanwhile, is a comparable pittance, at “only” $25 billion to $30 billion.

As the price tag of flood protection goes up, it is anything but clear just how high this is in the agenda of the Newsom administration or the California Legislature. Flood protection’s share of a proposed climate change bond, for example, is about half the slice that it has gotten in bonds approved earlier this century.

Why? Climate change means more than preparing for the occasional massive flood. Climate change is also threatening watersheds and water supplies. There is a small army of water interests fighting over supplies. The much smaller flood control community runs the risk of being the financial orphan in California’s climate change priorities.

Until, of course, it really, really floods.

“What are we obsessed about for the last 15 years? Drought,” said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center. “Eventually we’ll have a ... big, damaging flood and we’ll get our eye back on the ball.”

As a region in the valley, Sacramento is in comparatively good shape. The region has spent an estimated $5 billion since 2005, most of it from the federal government, on a variety of projects. A new spillway at Folsom Dam on the American River, for example, can release more water earlier in storm cycles. Downstream levee improvements can carry more water. And levee strengthening projects on the Sacramento River better protect at-risk communities like Natomas.

But flood protection is never over.

“The environmentalists that work in flood are really thin,” said Senior Policy Advocate Ron Stork of the Sacramento-based Friends of the River, a dean among his small group of peers.

Drought — the scarcity of water — can dominate the agenda by its very number of participants.

“The water supply folks are always knocking at the doors of legislators saying, ‘Fix my water problems,’” Stork said. “The flood people may try, but I don’t think the doors get opened that often.”

There are some statistics to back his feelings up. Since 2000, according to an analysis by the Public Policy Institute of California, flood protection projects received about 27% of the funds of resource bonds approved by state voters. But that percentage appears to be slipping.

A $15.5 billion climate change bond making its way through the California Legislature at present has only 11% is funding dedicated to flood protection, $1.65 billion. This should serve as a red flag to flood control advocates, because this bond was crafted in a winter marked by more than 30 atmospheric rivers slamming California and chart-busting rain and snowfall totals.

Why is flood control losing ground? When it comes to climate change, there are many needs. The title of this bond illustrates the quandary: “The Drought, Flood and Water Resilience, Wildfire and Forest Resilience, Coastal Resilience, Extreme Heat Mitigation, Biodiversity and Nature-Based Climate Solutions, Climate Smart Agriculture, Park Creation and Outdoor Access and Clean Energy Bond Act of 2024.”

The bond has about 1.5 time the money for wildfire and forest resilience needs, for example, than flood control.

“The (climate change) problem is so big, people don’t know where to start half the time,” said State Senator Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), the bond’s author. With so many needs, “ultimately it’s about trying to find the balance,” he said.

Both Stork and Mount worry about Central Valley communities like Stockton and Lathrop with huge flood exposure that remains unaddressed. Also in the cross-hairs of climate change is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the 1,100 square-mile estuary where the rivers merge before heading to San Francisco Bay, with 1,100 miles of levees.

“I try not to think about it, because it can be a bit depressing,” Stork said. “You got these peak discharges that are coming in from the tributaries that are going to be greater. That is not going to be pleasant for the Delta. And then you have the slow drip, drip, drip of ceaseless sea level rise. It kills you slowly.”

If there is a lesson from Sacramento’s success in recent decades on improving flood protection, it’s on the funding front. In the best of worlds, the state and federal governments will pay 90% of a flood protection project. But communities that do not come up with that 10% match, typically from a property assessment, are at the back of the line.

Mount worries less about competition for dollars inside California and sees states with more frequent flooding disasters, like Florida, as the money sumps for federal dollars. His homegrown solution is for California to step up annual spending to about $3 billion towards improving flood infrastructure. Spending that amount every year can whittle away at some very big problems.

For the Bay Area and its $110 billion in flood needs, “two billion a year for 50 years (isn’t) bad,” Mount said. “If you spread it out, you’re in good shape.”

We were so, so lucky last year. If some atmospheric rivers in the second half of the winter had been ultra-warm events from the south, that would have quickly melted massive snow packs, and downstream flooding would have been far worse. One of these winters, that will happen. And California will be consumed by the flood’s fury.

In the meantime, flood protection is like a hungry mouth that is inadequately fed by the political powers in Sacramento and Washington.'",climate,flood
"'HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Wednesday was National Letter of Intent signing day for many high school seniors and scores of Hawaii student-athletes put pen to paper in Waikiki.

The Aloha Leadership Foundation held their annual signing day at the Princess Kaiulani Hotel with 59 Hawaii seniors making their commitment to play at the next level.

An event started by Doris Sullivan and the Pacific Island Athletic Alliance, it was picked up by the Foundation after Doris Retired in 2016.

“Our organization is continuing on that legacy of recognizing Hawaii high school athletes,” Kawika Kane of the Aloha Leadership Foundation told Hawaii News Now. “The opportunity to highlight their accomplishments, recognize them, meaning not just the student athlete, but the parents and the whole support system of teachers and the coaches and administrators.”

The ballroom was filled with many of the state’s top prospects like Malu Garcia — one of Moanalua high school’s top players — made her commitment to play for the University of Iowa.

The outside hitter was in awe of all of the sports represented this morning.

“From soccer to volleyball, baseball, softball, men’s volleyball,” Garcia said. “Everyone just coming out, showing their commitment, showing all their hard work and their passion for their sports.”

There were others, like Saint Louis’ Sean Yamaguchi who was taken aback when thinking about his baseball journey.

From a Little League World Series title in 2018 to when he committed to Nevada.

“Just taking a step back and really enjoying the process is something very special and, you know, you’re only going to live this process once,” Yamaguchi said. “My grandpa always told me, you know, just enjoy the process, keep working hard and great things will happen for you and I really think that.”

There were also athletes that decided to stay home and play for the home team. Kapolei’s Malinah Purcell-Telefoni signed to join Robyn Ah Mow and the Rainbow Wahine.

“Being able to play in front of my family is a blessing,” Purcell-Telefoni said, “I’m just excited to play in front of my family for the next years to come.”

"'GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin archaeologists are crediting a man and daughter with discovering the remains of what could be a ship that ran aground during the deadly Peshtigo Fire more than 150 years ago.

Tim Wollak and his 6-year-old daughter, Henley, of Peshtigo, were fishing on Lake Michigan in the bay of Green Bay near Green Island in August when their sonar picked up something Henley thought was an octopus, WLUK-TV reported Wednesday.

Wollak posted photos of the sonar images on Facebook, which eventually drew the attention of the Wisconsin Historical Society. The society posted a note Monday on Facebook saying an underwater remote vehicle surveyed the site Dec. 4 and confirmed the object is the wreck of a three-masted sailing ship submerged in 8 to 10 feet of water.

Archaeologists believe the ship may be the 122-foot-long George L. Newman. The ship was hauling lumber from Little Suamico on the evening of Oct. 8, 1871, when it became enveloped in thick smoke from the Peshtigo Fire and ran aground on the southeast point of Green Island.

The keeper of the island’s lighthouse rescued the crew, according to the historical society’s tweet, but the ship was abandoned and was eventually covered with sand and forgotten.

The historical society plans to survey the wreck again in the spring of 2024 and may push to list the site on the National Register of Historic Places.

“I don’t know how we top it,” Wollak told WLUK. “I told her (Henley) I’m pretty sure there’s no one else in her school that has ever found a shipwreck that nobody had recorded before … I guess we’ll just have to fish more and see if we can find more shipwrecks.”

The National Weather Service ranks the Peshtigo Fire as the most devastating forest fire in U.S. history, claiming more than 1,200 lives.

According to survivor accounts, railroad workers clearing land for tracks started a brush fire Oct. 8, 1871, that grew into an inferno that scorched between 1.2 million and 1.5 million acres. The fire skipped east over the waters of Green Bay and set fire to parts of Door and Kewaunee counties.

The city of Peshtigo was consumed in an hour, according to the National Weather Service’s website. Sixteen other towns burned as well.'",climate,forest fire
"'The four major professional U.S. team sports — football, baseball, basketball and hockey — continue to attract fans by the millions. And emerging sports, such as pickleball, find new followers.

But some say it’s time to raise the flag for a different game — literally.

Flag football, the tackle-free version of American football, is quickly gaining ground among participants and could become a legitimate spectator sport in the coming years. Consider the recent announcement that flag football will debut at the Olympics during the 2028 summer games in Los Angeles, joining such other sports as squash, cricket, lacrosse, softball and baseball as ones making their first appearance or returning to the prominent international athletic event.

The Olympics news is the culmination of a years-long effort to grow the sport into a serious contender, a push that has been heavily supported by the tackle-oriented National Football League, plus a host of other businesses and organizations.

And it’s a push with big dollars attached to it — and lots of heady optimism.

“Flag football is a movement,” says Jeff Lewis, founder of the American Flag Football League, a professional platform that’s set to debut next year. Lewis told MarketWatch that tens of millions of dollars have gone into establishing the AFFL, though he declined to provide a specific figure.

Some 7.1 million Americans played flag football in 2022, according to research from the Sports & Industry Fitness Association, an increase of 8.4% versus five years earlier. Participants covered almost every group and demographic: men and women, college and high-school graduates, East and West Coast residents.

The game is proving especially popular with young women, say representatives with USA Football, the governing body for both tackle and flag football in the U.S. and the organization that will be behind the men’s and women’s national teams competing in 2028 Olympics.

USA Football notes that girls’ flag football is now sanctioned as a varsity sport in eight states, with more offering pilot programs. Plus, there’s a national women’s flag football championship at the collegiate level.

And flag football is very much poised to go pro. The AFFL will launch in 2024 with a men’s division, with teams in Boston, Dallas, Las Vegas and Nashville, according to Lewis. A women’s division will follow in 2025.

Lewis, a veteran financial professional, said that franchise fees are going for $3 million. He’s particularly bullish about the prospects for the women’s league, seeing flag football as becoming the biggest women’s spectator sport, as measured by revenue, within the next decade.

In other words, bigger than even the WNBA, which already brings in at least $180 million in revenue.

“‘Flag football is a movement.’” — Jeff Lewis, founder of the American Flag Football League

Meanwhile, the NFL’s commitment to flag is focused on the youth aspect — specifically, the NFL Flag program, which encompasses 2,000-plus youth leagues with 700,000-plus boys and girls, ages 5 to 17, participating. (There are also flag leagues run independently of the NFL.)

The NFL hasn’t completely ignored the pro aspect, either: The league turned the Pro Bowl — its version of an all-star game — into a flag football event this year. The idea was to address the fact that players in previous Pro Bowls were concerned about risking injury to participate in what is essentially an exhibition contest. Switching to the non-tackle format solved the problem and didn’t seem to take away from the excitement, at least according to league officials.

“I don’t see us going back [to tackle] in any way,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said of the Pro Bowl flag format after this year’s game.

Indeed, the safety factor is key to flag football’s growing popularity, especially at a time when there’s increased awareness of the risk of injuries, especially concussions, in tackle football. Participation in high-school tackle, for example, is down 12.2% from its 2008-09 peak.

Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and a sports-business expert, goes so far as to say that promoting flag is “a backup strategy” for the NFL. By that, he means if tackle football suffers a much greater decline in popularity or is perhaps even banned, the league has another version of the game ready to showcase.

But more likely, Zimbalist and others say the NFL sees promoting flag as a fun way to introduce people to football in general, with the idea that it will hopefully lead them to watch the professional tackle version the league embodies.

“It’s going to drive fandom” for the NFL, says Scott Hallenback, chief executive of USA Football.

That could be critical with women, since it’s a group that has been key to the league’s growth plans. Of course, Taylor Swift’s sudden interest in the game, due to her budding relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, hasn’t hurt in terms of developing a female fan base, either.

“‘It’s leaps and bounds more entertaining to watch than a pickleball match.” ” — Former NFL player Izell Reese, who is chief executive of RCX Sports, the company that runs the NFL Flag program.

Flag football has other factors in its favor, say advocates. On the participant side, it’s a relatively low-cost game to play since it requires so little equipment — unlike tackle football, there’s no reason to use protective gear.

“You just need a ball,” says Danette Leighton, chief executive of the Women’s Sports Foundation.

Well, you also need flags. And if you want proof that flag football is becoming more popular, just speak to David Berg, founder of Shruumz, an Austin, Texas, company that specializes in flag football gear. He says sales have been climbing at least 50% annually since he started the business in 2019.

Berg adds that while the level of play can be very competitive in the upper echelons of the sport, the appeal of flag football is that it can be appreciated by all sorts of people at all skill levels.

“There are dads who play in their tennis shoes,” Berg says.

In terms of spectator potential, particularly when it comes to television networks or streaming platforms, some say the best thing going in flag’s favor is that there’s simply a need for more product to fill all the slots these viewing outlets have. Think how the backyard game of cornhole has even found its way to TV.

“There’s a window for niche sports that never used to be,” says Zimbalist.

Pickleball is making a play for the spectator crowd, too. There’ a pickleball pro league and plenty of pickleball for home viewing. But the flag football crowd argues that their game makes for better viewing, given that it’s not too different from the NFL tackle football that is an American obsession.

“It’s leaps and bounds more entertaining to watch than a pickleball match,” says Izell Reese, a former NFL player and chief executive of RCX Sports, the company that runs the NFL Flag program.

Still, the very fact that flag football isn’t tackle may ultimately stand in its way, some say. Even enthusiasts admit this.

Take Odessa “OJ” Jenkins, founder of the Women’s National Football Conference, a professional women’s tackle league that is developing a flag league as well. Like others, Jenkins sees flag as a “pipeline” for people to build that basic awareness of football. But nothing can compete with the intensely physical version of the sport that tackle represents.

“Tackle football is the queen and king” of the game, she says.

But for Princeton, N.J., resident Jennifer Lea Cohan, flag is still the version of the sport her 13-year-old daughter, Milla Petrecca, appreciates. As a mother, Cohan says she likes the fact that the game has a lower risk of injury. Meanwhile, her daughter just likes the competitive aspect.

The only problem? Milla’s team isn’t exactly the star of its league. “They’re a little win-challenged,” Cohan concedes.'",sports,football

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Nick Kyrgios has confirmed he won't compete at the Australian Open next month because of ongoing injury concerns.

The 28-year-old Australian said on social media he'll miss the Grand Slam for a second straight year and did not put a timeline on his return from a lingering wrist injury.

“Obviously had a really tough year with injury, had that knee surgery and came back a little bit too soon and set me back a little bit, then obviously had some wrist issues,” Kyrgios said on the subscription website OnlyFans, which he joined on Friday. “So this is a very disappointing time for me, but I won’t be able to compete at the 2024 Australian Open.

“Obviously heartbreaking. I’ve had so many amazing memories there and I just want to really get back to playing at the top of my game and doing it right and I need a little more time.

Kyrgios was the runner-up to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon in 2022 but played in just one official singles match in 2023, a straight sets loss on grass at Stuttgart.

Kyrgios teamed with Thanasi Kokkinakis to win the 2022 Australian Open men’s doubles championship.

“Even with extreme heat like we saw this summer, these deaths are preventable,” said Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director for the department. “This tragic record reminds us that as a community, we have more work to do to prevent these deaths.” Sunenshine further explained, “Maricopa County residents and visitors should continue to practice heat safety and check on neighbors, even this late in the season, because heat illness and deaths can occur all the way into November due to rising temperatures.”

Earlier this week, Arizona’s Family reported that one of those who died from heat stroke was a volunteer for Feed Phoenix amidst a dangerous heatwave in September.

What heat prevention steps do I need to take in the Valley?

Limit outdoor activities to the coolest parts of the day

When spending extended amounts of time outdoors, go indoors to an air-conditioned location frequently

Don’t rely on fans as your primary source of cooling, especially when outdoor temperatures are 95 degrees or higher

Drink water throughout the day to prevent dehydration

Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunscreen, and lightweight clothes outdoors

Never leave kids, older adults, pets, and others who may rely on you inside of a parked car

Check on friends and neighbors, especially older adults, to ensure they have functioning air conditioning/cooling and enough water and supplies

"'PORTLAND Ore. (KPTV) - Hoop dreams for a WNBA team here in Portland won’t be coming true – at least for now.

The league announced Wednesday it is “deferring” a franchise for Portland – pointing to facility limitations as the main obstacle.

The announcement that the WNBA will be pausing its pursuit of a franchise in Portland – for now – hit particularly hard for Jenny Nguyen, who is the founder and owner of The Sports Bra in northeast Portland.

“Huge disappointment,” Nguyen said. “I felt the fire and the spark was there and I was so sure that it was going to happen.”

Nguyen said her love for basketball was one of the driving forces that inspired the vision for a bar & restaurant that’s dedicated to women’s sports.

“Basketball is my number one sport, I’m a big fan. When the WNBA was here 20 years ago, I was a gigantic fan and I saw Portland show up,” Nguyen said. “And to see thousands and thousands of people show up to those games, every home game, it just reiterated to me that power of women’s sports and the potential of if you can see it, you can be it.”

In a letter to Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on Wednesday, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert recognized experiencing first-hand the “enthusiastic gathering of women’s sports advocates” that was hosted at The Sports Bra in February.

However, Engelbert points to obstacles surrounding facilities as a reason why the “consideration of a WNBA franchise for Portland will be deferred for now until the timing and scope of the arena improvements are settled.”

Senator Wyden has been a big advocate of this effort and sent a statement that said, “Senator Wyden is committed to continue working hard with everybody in Portland who’s teaming up to bring our city and state a WNBA franchise. Portland and all of Oregon have long proven a hotbed for women’s sports, and he has no doubt the WNB would succeed here in a similar fashion.”

People said they’re still hopeful this journey isn’t over.

“I think Portland market would be a slam dunk for the WNBA franchise,” Nguyen said.

In the letter, the commissioner also reiterated that when the time is right, the league looks “forward to pursuing prospects to bringing the WNBA to Portland” and said the “league and a prospective local ownership group have been working with local officials to resolve issues related to the Moda Center.”

"'What to Know 6ABC in Philadelphia said its news helicopter crashed in a wooded area of New Jersey Tuesday night.

Action News said its pilot, Monroe Smith, and photographer, Chris Dougherty, from its news team were in the helicopter when it went down about 8 p.m. Tuesday in Wharton State Forest in Hammonton.

The helicopter was returning from an assignment at the Jersey Shore when it crashed in the woods, Channel 6 said.

A Philadelphia news helicopter crashed in the New Jersey Pinelands Tuesday night, killing both journalists on board.

Chopper 6, the news chopper of 6ABC, crashed near Mullica River Road in the Wharton State Forest in Burlington County, around 8 p.m. Tuesday, a devastated Channel 6 news team said. Officials said the crash happened in a remote section of the vast forest.

Both the chopper pilot and photographer on board were killed, 6ABC Action News said Wednesday morning.

""They have a long history with our station and have been working as part of the Action News team for years,"" 6ABC wrote on its website.

6ABC's television news chopper crashed Tuesday night in a wooded area of Burlington County. NBC10's Randy Gyllenhaal and Matt DeLucia report from near the scene in Wharton State Forecast, while NBC meteorologist Bill Henley takes a look at what the weather was like at the time of Tuesday night's crash.

The area where the chopper went down -- near Shamong -- is densely wooded and very dark at night.

""Due to the remote location of the scene and the limited visibility, it was determined... that the investigation would be suspended until some time after daybreak,"" New Jersey State Park Police Chief George Fedorczyk said.

No word yet on how the crash happened.

Where was the news chopper heading?

Channel 6 reported that it leases the helicopter from U.S. Helicopters Inc., which is based in North Carolina. A spokesperson said company officials were not prepared to comment Wednesday morning.

According to online flight data, the chopper -- what the NTSB called an American Eurocopter AS350-B2 -- had left Northeast Airport, went into New Jersey toward the Jersey Shore and was on its way back before crashing. 6ABC said the chopper was returning from covering something near the Jersey Shore.

What is the timeline of events, investigation?

Here is the timeline of events, according to Fedorczyk:

New Jersey State Park Police were first contacted about a missing helicopter around 10:50 p.m.

Just after midnight, a state park police officer found a debris field a few hundred yards from Mullica River Road in Washington Township.

Around 3:15 a.m. an investigator with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) arrived for ""an initial assessment,"" Fedorczyk said.

Another Philadelphia-based news news helicopter captured video of the wreckage, 6ABC said. Video of the wreckage site showed scattered debris, with some pieces on fire or smoking, as authorities searched with flashlights in the darkness.

State police, state park police, state forest fire service and the Hamilton Township police department secured the scene ahead of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) arriving on scene to lead the investigation, Fedorczyk said.

NTSB is investigating the Dec. 19 crash of an American Eurocopter AS350-B2 near Shamong, New Jersey. — NTSB Newsroom (@NTSB_Newsroom) December 20, 2023

A state trooper’s cruiser idled Wednesday near the forested scene, where paved roads turn to gravel and signs advised that motor vehicles were restricted from entering the area near the forest.

The site is part of the Pinelands, a million-acre wilderness area that stretches across more than seven counties and features dense woods, rivers and rare plant species.

Authorities asked the public to steer clear of Mullica River, Quaker Bridge and Mill roads throughout Wednesday due to the ongoing investigation.

Wednesday evening, the FAA paused their investigation due to limited visibility. They resumed their investigation on Thursday.

Broken hearts in the Philadelphia news community

It was a sad morning for all of the Philadelphia news community. TV stations in Philly have used choppers in daily news coverage for decades.

""Know that our thoughts are with the pilots, their families and the media community, Fedorczyk said.

My heart breaks for the families of this chopper crew, our own @NBCPhiladelphia chopper crew who knew them, and of course my prayers go out to the entire @6abc family. This is just so terribly sad https://t.co/avYcgMVznH — Tim Furlong (@tfurlong) December 20, 2023

It's a sad morning for Philly news. Condolences to our friends @6abc https://t.co/UD4ySpMSUp — Matt DeLucia (@MattDeLucia) December 20, 2023

“Our hearts are just broken for these men. They're broken for their families,” 6ABC reporter Katherine Scott said Wednesday morning, reporting from near the scene of the crash.

During a live report in which she choked up with emotion, Action News reporter Maggie Kent told of speaking with colleagues of the crew members at Northeast Philadelphia Airport, where the chopper was based.

“They are described as the best guys that you would want to know, on the job for decades,” she said. “They are highly skilled in what they do. They loved their craft.”

What will the NTSB be investigating?

The NTSB released a statement to NBC10 on Wednesday about their investigation. They promised a preliminary report within 30 days.

""An NTSB investigator is traveling to the scene,"" the federal agency said Wednesday morning. ""Once on site, the investigator will begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the aircraft. The aircraft will then be recovered to a secure facility for further evaluation.""

""NTSB investigations involve three primary areas: the pilot, the aircraft and the operating environment. As part of this process, investigators will gather the following information and records:

Flight track data

Recordings of any air traffic control communications

Aircraft maintenance records

Weather forecasts and actual weather and lighting conditions around the time of the accident

Pilot’s license, ratings and recency of flight experience

72-hour background of the pilot to determine if there were any issues that could have affected the pilot’s ability to safety operate the flight

Witness statements

Electronic devices that could contain information relevant to the investigation

Any available surveillance video, including from doorbell cameras""

""During the on-scene phase of the investigative process, the NTSB does not determine or speculate about the cause of the accident.""

It could take up to two years for a final report.

""A probable cause of the crash along with any contributing factors will be detailed in the final report, which is expected in 12-24 months,"" the NTSB said.

During a Thursday morning press conference, Todd Gunther, investigator-in-charge at NTSB, went into more detail about the investigation. He said the NTSB will be on site for the next three days.

""We're going to be looking at things such as flight path, flight path angle, the structure of the helicopter, its power plant, which is the engine,"" Gunther said. ""Getting witness interviews, witness statements, anybody who may have seen what happened with the helicopter.""

Gunther also spoke about how large the debris field is at the scene of the crash.

""The debris field is about 100 yards long that goes through the trees, and the helicopter itself is in a densely wooded area,"" he said. ""We'll be using 4-wheel drive vehicles to get most of the way in and then we'll be moving in farther. The plan is to be able to bring in some heavy equipment so we can start moving some things around.""

Gunther also said investigators will look at the helicopter's maintenance records, the history of Chopper 6 flights and Smith's physiology.

A preliminary report on the crash will be released in 10-15 days and within about 18 months, the NTSB will produce a factual and final report on the incident, including a statement of probable cause, according to Gunther.

There have been other deadly helicopter crashes involving staff from television stations in the United States. Among them was a July 2007 crash, when two helicopters from KNXV-TV and KTVK-TV collided over Phoenix while covering a police chase. Four people — both pilots and two photographers — were killed.

"'Despite recent rain, much of the northwest is still under drought. Drought Monitors are tools that can help people plan around those conditions.

Example video title will go here for this video

Next up in 5

SPOKANE, Wash. — Rainy season is back in the northwest, but a lot of the region is still under drought.

KREM 2 talked with Karin Bumbaco and Larry O'Neill, Washington and Oregon's state climatologists. While both are happy to finally see rain in the northwest, they say that rain isn't enough.

It often takes a complete atmospheric shift to see lasting change in drought conditions.

""Quite difficult to know when a drought ends,"" O'Neill said.

Tools like the drought monitor show drought conditions across the country. Despite recent rain, O'Neill says the northwest needs to make up some of the precipitation deficits of the past 6-12 months.

The northwest gets most of its moisture in the spring, winter and fall. So, when the seasons fall behind...

""Our reservoirs will be much lower than normal,"" O'Neill said.

Even when the northwest gets above average snowpack, having a warm spring, like this year, makes a big difference.

""That caused that snowpack to come off quickly and lose that water supply quickly,"" Bumbaco said.

And that's happening more often, so eventually...

""The dry spell goes on for so long that it's no longer considered abnormal,"" O'Neill said.

That's why having a drought monitor is important. It acts a visual for the date that can be used for city planning, agriculture and other aspects of day-to-day life.

"'On the heels of the Great ShakeOut earthquake drill, The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has released seven new tsunami evacuation maps and several tsunami simulation videos for communities along the state’s northern Pacific coast.

The new maps, produced by DNR's Washington Geological Survey, shows the times it would take to evacuate on foot from the tsunami zones caused by a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. They show the inundation zone, evacuation routes, and use colors to represent the time it takes to walk to safety from any point within the inundation zone.

“We’ve seen around the world how devastating tsunamis are for coastal communities,” said Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz. “In the event of a tsunami, nothing is more important than knowing where to go to be safe and how long it will take to get there. That is why our geologists are doing the vital work of making this life-saving information easily accessible for everyone who lives, works, or plays along Washington’s coast.”

The new maps cover Ocean City to Copalis Beach, Copalis Beach to Pacific Beach, Moclips, Taholah, Queets, Hoh, and La Push. The study assumed a walking pace is 2.46 miles per hour, however effective walk times vary based on topography.

A tsunami produced by an earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone can follow an earthquake within a mere 10-15 minutes. That’s why DNR researchers produce these maps – so anyone along the coast can know their route before a tsunami strikes.

The Washington Geological Survey has also released three new sets of simulation videos for the central Washington coast that show the extent and depth of tsunami inundation (on-land flooding) and maximum current velocities following a modeled magnitude 9.0 Cascadia earthquake and tsunami. The videos also provide an estimate for how much time will transpire between the earthquake and the arrival of tsunami waves on shore.

The new simulation videos reveal the dynamics of the tsunami waves by showing how wave heights change throughout the entirety of the tsunami event, a span of many hours.

The simulation videos also show current velocities, which is particularly important for assessing maritime hazards. Partially enclosed bodies of water like bays and harbors can be particularly dangerous during a tsunami due to tumultuous and rapid currents produced during a tsunami.

The simulation videos are viewable on the DNR YouTube channel and downloadable as MP4 files at https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/geologic-hazards/tsunamis#tsunami-simulation-videos

The new pedestrian evacuation maps and maps for other communities are available through an interactive map on the DNR web site: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/programs-and-services/geology/geologic-hazards/tsunamis#preparation-and-evacuation.6

The interactive map also provides access to tsunami evacuation brochures for areas that do not have walk time maps yet. Other information about impacts from earthquakes to Washington communities is available on DNR’s Geologic Information Portal at: https://geologyportal.dnr.wa.gov

323 years since Cascadia last quaked

The geologic record shows the Cascadia subduction zone – the offshore area where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate is pulled under the larger North American plate – produces megathrust quakes about every 300 to 600 years.

These maps are modeled on a magnitude 9 Cascadia earthquake. The onshore and offshore geologic record shows the last big earthquake happened in 1700 creating a tsunami that hit all the Pacific Northwest and traveled across the ocean to Japan.

By using the models for large Cascadia events, the maps provide a scenario that is useful for smaller events as well.

"'The Pirates agreed to a minor league contract with reliever Ryder Ryan, reports Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (X link). He’ll be in MLB camp as a non-roster invitee.

Ryan made his major league debut last season. He pitched once for the Mariners, turning in a scoreless inning with two strikeouts and a walk against Baltimore. The North Carolina product otherwise spent his year with the M’s Triple-A club in Tacoma. He had a nice showing for the Rainiers, working to a 3.76 ERA across 55 innings. The righty punched out just under a quarter of his opponents against a slightly high 9.6% walk rate.

The 28-year-old has appeared in parts of three Triple-A campaigns, allowing 4.24 earned runs per nine in 159 1/3 frames. While Ryan has very little major league experience, he has been of interest to a few teams as a depth arm. Originally drafted by Cleveland, he was dealt to the Mets for Jay Bruce in 2017 and flipped to Seattle in 2020 as the player to be named later in a Todd Frazier deal.

Seattle outrighted Ryan from the 40-man roster last month. He became a minor league free agent, setting the stage for him to join a fourth organization of his career. The Bucs had a middling relief group, finishing 19th with a 4.22 ERA and 14th with a 23.7% strikeout percentage.'",sports,baseball
"'EDITORIAL: A Stadium Proposal That Could Actually Work

After nearly a decade of hucksters with proposals trying to squeeze Rhode Island taxpayers for tens of millions of dollars for stadium schemes that are dripping with self-profiting and with minimum benefits to the community, someone is finally offering a sports stadium concept with minimal financial risk for the public and plenty of upside.

This proposal brings minor league baseball back to Rhode Island.

On Sunday, GoLocal first reported that Art Solomon, a wildly successful local businessman with a track record of community philanthropy and success in owning minor league baseball, has an idea.

The concept is to expand the Rhode Island College baseball facility from a few hundred to 3,500 seats. The state funds that expansion via a bond issue — and Solomon buys the team, pays the players, and handles the promotions.

The team would play in Major League Baseball’s “Draft League.”

The season in that league runs from June through August and is a great feeder to the higher minors and majors. No cold April and May nights with a nearly empty stadium.

The upside is Rhode Island gets a minor league baseball team with a proven owner — he owns a team in New Hampshire (AA), he owned a team in Kentucky (A), and his children own the Hartford Yard Goats (AA) — maybe one of the all-time greatest names in sports.

The downside is Rhode Island pays for a really nice 9but not a really expensive stadium) for the RIC baseball team, and the high school state championships have a tremendous place to play.

This is a proposal worth a hard look. Unlike other stadium concepts, this one appears to be void of hucksters and self-dealing.

Let the discussion begin.

An editorial is the opinion of a publication — specifically, the ownership. While based on facts and news reporting, it is an opinion intended to discuss critical community issues. Often, the opinion is written with the intention of positive change. GoLocal editorials have sparked conversations, change, and even the naming of a bridge. LEARN MORE HERE

"'When the 1926-era Palm Beach house known as Villa Vera Maria at 137 El Vedado Road was designated a Palm Beach landmark in 1990, a report prepared for the Landmarks Preservation Commission contained a nugget that captured the essence of the property in the Estate Section.

The report made note of the “fanciful Mediterranean Revival house” with “vigorous massing, a lavish use of arcading and, in general, a great deal of convincing picturesqueness.”

The home’s owners at the time of the designation were — and still are — retired businessman Jacques Cohen and his wife, Francoise. They purchased the ocean-block property in April 1987 and embarked on a historically sensitive renovation and restoration project. Because the house is landmarked, many of its exterior walls are protected from significant alteration unless the project is approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission.

“We modernized it but kept its character,” says Jacques Cohen, who co-founded Prestige Cosmetics Co.

The Cohens maintain another residence in St. Helena, California, and have made plans to find a smaller home in Palm Beach. As such, their five-bedroom, 6½-bath home and guesthouse — with a combined 7,402 square feet of living space, inside and out — is on the market. William Raveis South Florida agents Jack Elkins and Shirley Wyner have co-listed the property for $29 million.

Running a cosmetics company is how Jacques made his living, but his knowledge of beauty is far more than skin deep, especially when it comes to architecture.

Villa Vera Maria seemed instantly familiar to him when he first encountered it, he says. He grew up in the same kind of architectural environment in Casablanca, Morocco, where his family’s home was built around a courtyard similar to the one at Villa Vera Maria.

The layout of the landmarked house at 137 El Vedado Road pivots around the tiled entrance courtyard, which has an arched loggia opposite the main entrance gate. Doorways in the loggia lead to the foyer and stair hall. The house is listed for sale at $29 million.

His family later moved to Canada and he attended college in Montreal, studying engineering.

“With all the work we’ve done, this is an easy house to maintain,” he says. “I’m not a handyman, but I can do things. But here, there is nothing to do.”

He still marvels at the home’s indoor-outdoor aesthetic: “This is a quintessential Palm Beach house, built to live outside while you are still living inside,” he notes. “It has unique architecture. It is all open.”

Moving from room to room often means stepping out to connecting open-air corridors, he explains.

“They are covered obviously — and we love that kind of environment,” he says.

Front courtyard provides access to several parts of the Palm Beach house

The house stands on the northeast corner of South County Road and El Vedado Road, the third home from the beach.

El Vedado Road has long been considered one of the town’s top-tier addresses, along with the other two neighboring “El” streets — El Brillo Way and El Bravo Way. Dotted with historic and stately homes, El Vedado stretches between the Atlantic Ocean and a secluded lagoon on the Intracoastal Waterway.

Among their improvements, the Cohens redid the plumbing and electrical systems; installed air-conditioning; fitted the windows and doors with impact-resistant glass; modernized the bathrooms; and combined small rooms to make larger areas.

During their renovation, the Cohens combined the kitchen and dining room to create a state-of-the-art kitchen area suited for intimate gatherings and grand-scale entertaining. A contemporary-style dining table is at the far end. “We modernized (the house), but kept its character,” says Jacques Cohen.

The main house has a generalized H-shaped floor plan. A scrolled metal gate leads visitors into the front open-air courtyard, where a door opens directly into the living room to the west. On the north side of the courtyard is a covered loggia, with doorways that lead to the foyer and stair hall. On the east side of the “H” are the kitchen and dining room, and north of the living room are a study and guest bedroom suite.

“The (front) courtyard is really special. It has the original tile imported from Cuba, and all the gates are original. In the courtyard, there’s a (wall-mounted) wheel, with six (clock-style) ‘hands’ connected to different-sized bells. You turn the wheel and the bells ring — that’s our entrance bell,” he says.

In the courtyard’s covered area, a rectangle of architectural floor tile is signed in Arabic, he adds.

A revolving metal wheel with bells – the house’s “doorbell” – is mounted on the courtyard wall by the entrance gate.

Second floor features covered cloister with a terrace and an open-air tower room

Central to the second floor’s layout is a covered cloister that opens to a terrace. There, a stairway leads up to an open-air tower “room” where columns support the roof beams.

“In the tower, it’s very peaceful and you have a nice view of the pool,” Jacques says.

The main bedroom suite is in the east wing on the second floor, and two bedroom suites are in the west wing.

The guest house and porte-cochere are separate from the main residence.

The grotto-like swimming pool is surrounded by stone steps. The statue at the left was on the property when the Cohens bought the landmarked estate in 1987.

In the main home’s living room, original features include the high coffered ceiling with pecky-cypress beams; the working fireplace with its carved mantelpiece; and the original marble-tile flooring.

Leading to the west gardens, an arched door in the living room is framed with carved embellishments.

Another original door, which opens to the foyer, also is noteworthy, says Jacques.

“It’s amazing, an old hand-painted church door from Venice. I wish I could take it with me,” he says.

In the foyer itself, a massive pecky-cypress arched door leads to the first-floor bedroom and pool area, and the main staircase features the original Cuban tile.

Cohens installed a contemporary-style kitchen during their renovation

During their renovation, the Cohens combined the original dining room and kitchen.

“There used to be a wall between them. Now it’s an open, flowing space. We like (a) pure and clean (look) without clutter,” he explains. “We put in the ceramic tile floor, modern cabinetry, new counters and lighting.”

The space has a working fireplace with a carved marble mantel. French doors open to the courtyard.

In the main bedroom suite, more French doors open to a Juliet-style balcony with a treetop view. The Cohens installed limestone flooring in the bathrooms and bedroom and carved out space for closets.

They also completely rebuilt the guesthouse, which can double as staff quarters. With pecky-cypress ceilings, it has a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen.

The second-floor cloister looks out to a broad terrace that doubles as a sundeck. “When its windy, we put a lounge chair on the sundeck, and you don’t get the wind — you get the sun,” says homeowner Jacques Cohen.

ON THE MARKET IN PALM BEACH: Historic lakeside Palm Beach home lists at $30M, more than double what it sold for in 2021

The lot, which measures about seven-tenths of an acre, is extensively landscaped.

“A previous owner was a horticulturalist, and he planted some interesting trees. We just cleaned everything up, maintained the grounds and added the pool,” Jacques says.

The statues around the pool are original to the house, as are the fountains.

From the driveway, a paved walkway leads to a set of stairs and a door that opens directly into the living room.

Parting with their home will be difficult, he says.

“I am so used to this house — it’s going to be very hard to move out of here. We’ve lived in this house for 35 years. That’s a testimony to how much we love it.”

He adds: “We are the fourth family living in this house, so everyone stayed around 25 years on average.”

"'Parts of the Amazon rainforest is suffering its worst drought ever, according to new records.

Water levels of Brazil’s Negro River and Madeira River have reached a record low since official measurements began over a century ago.

The drought has left hundreds of riverine communities struggling to access drinkable water.

The Negro River, the Amazon’s second largest tributary, on Monday reached its lowest level since official measurements began near Manaus 121 years ago. The record confirms that this part of the world´s largest rainforest is suffering its worst drought, just a little over two years after its most significant flooding.

In the morning, the water level in the city´s port went as low as 44.3 feet, down from 98.5 feet registered in June 2021 — its highest level on record. The Negro River drains about 10% of the Amazon basin and is the world's sixth largest by water volume.

Madeira River, another main tributary of the Amazon, has also recorded historically low levels, causing the halt of the Santo Antonio hydroelectric dam, Brazil´s fourth largest.

AMAZON RAINFOREST COULD REACH 'POINT OF NO RETURN' AND VANISH IN 50 YEARS, EXPERTS SAY

Throughout Brazil´s Amazon, low river levels have left hundreds of riverine communities isolated and struggling to get access to drinkable water. The drought also has disrupted commercial navigation that supplies Manaus, a city of 2 million with a large industrial park.

Manaus is the largest city and capital of Amazonas, the state hit hardest by the drought. In late September, 55 of 62 municipalities there entered states of emergency due to the severe drought.

""There is no more water to go through. Navigation is over,"" boatman Cledson Lopes Brasil told The Associated Press.

Brasil operates in Marina do Davi port, a getaway to dozens of riverine communities, some of them with sandy beaches that attract tourists. The once bustling area is now surrounded by parched soil, with many boathouses high and dry.

For one month now, Brasil has switched to a lower-powered boat, better suited for shallow waters. Still, he can´t reach most communities along Taruma-Açu, a tributary of the Negro River. Some riverine dwellers must walk up to three hours to reach their houses — and tourism has stopped altogether.

Manaus and other nearby cities are also suffering from high temperatures and heavy smoke from nearby man-caused fires for deforestation and pasture clearance. The drought is also the likely cause of dozens of river dolphin deaths in Tefe Lake, near the Amazon River.

DEFORESTATION IN BRAZIL INCREASED 30% IN 12 MONTHS, AGENCY SAYS

This is a startling contrast to July 2021, when Negro River waters took over part of the Manaus downtown area. The historic flood, which also ruined crops of hundreds of riverine communities, lasted for about three months.

Negro River ends near Manaus, where it converges with the Amazon River, which is called the Solimoes River in Brazil upstream from this confluence. In Brazilian maps, this marks the beginning of the Amazon, with Negro as the second main tributary. In international maps, however, the Amazon River begins in Peru.

Philip Fearnside, an American researcher at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research, a public agency, expects the situation to deteriorate, both during the ongoing event and in the future with increasing frequency and severity of similar events with climate change.

He said surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is now warmer than during the ""Godzilla"" El Niño of 2015-2016 and is expanding. In the Amazon, these Pacific warmings primarily lead to droughts in the northern part of the region.

Moreover, a warm water patch in the tropical North Atlantic Ocean is causing drought in the southern part of the Amazon, similar to what happened in 2005 and 2010, according to researchers.

""The forecast is for the start of the rains to be delayed compared to normal, and for a drier-than-normal rainy season,"" Fearnside said. ""This could result not only in extreme low water this year, but also low levels in 2024.

"'Scientists say climate change is driving heatwaves across the planet, toppling previous records with alarming frequency.

European scientists say 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record after temperatures soared across the planet in October.

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the EU’s climate monitor, said on Wednesday that October was 0.4 degrees Celsius (0.7 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than the previous record for the month, set in 2019.

“When we combine our data with the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], then we can say that this is the warmest year for the last 125,000 years,” C3S’s Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said. Copernicus’s dataset goes back to 1940.

As climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, heats up the planet, previous records for extreme heat have been broken with dizzying frequency.

No corner of the planet has been spared: A study published in September, which also beat previous records, found that 2022 brought the most intense heatwave on record to Antarctica, the world’s coldest region.

In August and September during the southern hemisphere’s winter and spring, South American countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay struggled to cope with boiling temperatures of more than 40C (104F), in a heatwave that scientists said was made 100 times more likely by climate change.

“The amount that we’re smashing records by is shocking,” Burgess said.

Extreme heat can have deadly impacts, sapping the body of energy and causing dehydration in the short term and increasing the risk of health problems such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease.

People from poorer segments of society, especially those who engage in manual labour or work outside, are especially at risk.

“Heat kills, particularly in spring before people are acclimatised to it. Temperatures above 40C [104F] in early spring are incredibly extreme,” Julie Arrighi, director at the nonprofit Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said at the time of the heatwave in South America.

Conditions created by climate change have also contributed to a record wildfire season in Canada in 2023, which displaced thousands of people and burned more than 18.4 million hectares (45,467,390 acres) of land.

This year, factors driven by climate change have combined with those produced by the El Nino climate pattern, during which warmer surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean drive extreme weather around the world. The current hottest year on record is 2016 – another El Nino year.

The ongoing El Nino weather pattern is set to last until at least April, the World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday.

“This is a clear sign that we are going into a climate regime that will have more impact on more people,” said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. He is not associated with Copernicus.

“We better take this warning that we actually should have taken 50 years ago or more and draw the right conclusions.”

The European scientists’ findings were released three weeks before governments meet in Dubai for UN climate negotiations, known as COP28, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate what action to take on climate change.

A key issue at COP28 will be whether governments agree for the first time to phase out the burning of carbon dioxide-emitting fossil fuels.'",climate,forest fire

"'Saudi Arabia is pushing to purchase two of the most prestigious tournaments in professional tennis, with representatives of the country’s investment funds making recent pitches to take over events in Miami or Madrid, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions.

The tournaments are owned by IMG, the sports and entertainment conglomerate that is part of Endeavor, the sprawling representation and live event business. Saudi Arabia’s push to acquire one of the events represents its latest efforts to embed itself into the highest levels of the pro tours. Both Madrid and Miami are so-called 1,000-level events, just below the four Grand Slams in significance and on par with the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells and the Italian Open in Rome. Tournaments of this size have previously sold for several hundred million dollars.

According to people with knowledge of the discussions, who requested anonymity so as not to jeopardize their professional relationships, the talks are preliminary and could fall apart amid the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, but they come on the heels of a series of significant wins for Saudi Arabia in its effort to become a major player in international sports. A spokesman for Saudi Arabia’s sports interests did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.

Saudi Arabia is also continuing to pursue a long-term deal to host the WTA Tour Finals, the leading event in women’s tennis. That effort has been ongoing throughout this year and would represent the next triumph for a country that is determined to become a hub of international sports.

GO DEEPER The World Cup, golf, F1, cycling - why Saudi Arabia is buying sport

Earlier this week, the country scored its biggest victory yet, putting itself on the cusp of becoming the host of the 2034 World Cup. When Australia pulled out of the running, Saudi Arabia was left as the only candidate for the event, which FIFA, soccer’s world governing body, plans to award late in 2024, even though the event will not take place for 11 years.

Late last month, the country announced it would host two tennis exhibitions in late December, including a match between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, the world’s top two men’s players, whose budding rivalry has captivated the sport. In June, the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour and its rival, the long-established PGA Tour, agreed to the framework of a deal to merge following more than a year of acrimony and litigation.

Saudi officials have been in talks with top tennis executives for more than a year about multiple potential investments. Tennis officials are eager to placate their Saudi suitors and avoid the aggressive push the country made in golf, where it signed top players to contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars and upended the structure of the sport.

Industry experts see tennis as ripe for disruption because of its fractured management, which includes seven different governing bodies, each pursuing its own interests. Players have long complained about the 11-month season and receiving a lower percentage of revenues than athletes in team sports, in part because so much money goes to covering the costs of the governing bodies that use the players as independent contractors.

Saudi Arabia’s oil riches and its enthusiasm for becoming a major player in professional sports make it a strong candidate to cause the potential disruption, though its record on human rights can make it a problematic partner for sports organizations, especially those with athletes who are gay, as the country criminalizes homosexuality. Also, only in recent years has the ruling royal family granted rights to women — such as driving a car — that are basic in Western countries.

Nevertheless, during the summer, Saudi Arabia was a leading candidate to become the long-term host of the season-ending WTA Tour Finals. In September, The WTA Tour signed a one-year agreement with Cancun, Mexico, which is currently hosting the event, to put off the decision on a long-term destination until later this year.

Saudi Arabia did manage to win the rights to host the ATP Tour’s Next Gen Finals, which features the top players under the age of 21 in men’s tennis. That event is scheduled for late December.

The country’s determination to land a 1,000-level event — of which there were nine this year, six of which were “mixed” with both men and women competing — led to inquiries and preliminary discussions about Miami and Madrid with IMG, which represents some of the biggest stars of the sport, including Alcaraz. Both tournaments are among the most successful non-Grand Slam events and have long histories in their host cities, which could complicate efforts to move one of the tournaments to Saudi Arabia.

In 2019, IMG moved the Miami tournament from Key Biscayne, off the coast of downtown Miami, to Hard Rock Stadium, which is roughly 20 miles north of the city in Miami Gardens. The new set-up, with the main court wedged into the corner of the massive football stadium, has received mixed reviews from players and fans, but it appeared to hit its stride this year as the world emerged from the pandemic, with a record 386,000 fans attending the two-week event.

In addition, while IMG owns the Miami Open, it has a long-term operating agreement with the company controlled by Stephen Ross, the owner of the Miami Dolphins, which has built an expansive tennis complex in the Hard Rock Stadium parking lot.

IMG purchased the Madrid Open last year. It quickly began investing in improving the facilities and hospitality at the event.

Its parent company, Endeavor, had previously received a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia but returned the money following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, who was killed by agents of the Saudi government at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018.

In an interview last week, Steve Simon, chief executive of the WTA Tour, said no decision has been made about a new long-term partnership, but said he expected to have a deal in place by the end of the year. In recent days, WTA leaders advised players participating in the competition in Mexico on how to respond to questions about playing in Saudi Arabia, suggesting they note that a decision has not been made yet, but consider saying:

“I’m happy to play wherever the WTA Finals is hosted, it’s a prestigious event.”

And, “Wherever the finals is held next year, I trust that the WTA will continue to follow its mission to build a strong future for women’s tennis.”

And, “I’m thankful for the chance to show more women and girls and people around the world all that tennis has to offer.”

Most female players have largely avoided the topic during the year, though during the U.S. Open, Jessica Pegula, a member of the WTA Tour’s Players’ Council, said the tour should require a guarantee that they will be part of a process of making changes in the country.

“Unfortunately a lot of places don’t pay women a lot of money,” Pegula said. “It’s unfortunate that a lot of women’s sports, we don’t have the luxury to say no to some things.”

"'As Taylor Swift processes the unexpected death of one of her fans, Travis Kelce has remained by her side.

“She is so grateful she’s had Travis,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly about the couple. “He’s been a huge support system for her right now. Her family has been there, but it’s different to have a boyfriend to lean on.”

According to the insider, Swift, 33, is still reeling after a 23-year-old fan named Ana Clara Benevides Machado died while attending the Eras Tour concert on Friday, November 17.

“She was completely beside herself and it’s been so hard for her to talk about,” the source adds, noting that the singer’s team “reached out” to the fan’s family.

Concert organizer Time for Fun (T4F) confirmed Machado’s death on Saturday, November 18, citing the heatwave in Brazil.

“Last night, Ana Clara felt unwell and was promptly attended to by the team of firefighters and paramedics, being taken to the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos [on-site medic] for first aid protocol,” a post on T4F’s X (formerly Twitter) page read. Given the situation, the medical team chose to transfer her to Salgado Filho Hospital, where, after almost an hour of emergency care, she unfortunately died.”

Swift spoke out via Instagram Story hours after the show took place, “I can’t believe I’m writing these words but it is with a shattered heart that I say we lost a fan earlier tonight before my show. I can’t even tell you how devastated I am by this. There’s very little information I have other than the fact that she was so incredibly beautiful and far too young.”

Swift noted that she would not address the loss on stage. “I’m not going to be able to speak about this from stage because I feel overwhelmed by grief when I even try to talk about it,” she said. ”I want to say now I feel this loss deeply and my broken heart goes out to her family and friends. This is the last thing I ever thought would happen when we decided to bring this tour to Brazil.”

Ana Clara’s father, Weiny Machado, subsequently asked local officials to launch an investigation into what caused his daughter’s death.

“I lost my only daughter, a happy and intelligent girl,” he told local newspaper Folha de São Paulo on Saturday. “She was about to graduate in Psychology next April, saving money. I have no words to express my pain. She left home to fulfill a dream and came back dead.”

He explained: “I want it to be found out whether they were in fact prohibited from bringing water, whether there was negligence in providing assistance. I know that the singer was handing out water to her fans, and that is absurd for an event of this size. Nothing will bring my daughter back, but I hope that, if negligence is confirmed, someone will be punished, so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.”

After fans pointed out that Swift made multiple attempts to give concertgoers water during Friday’s performance, the next show was postponed due to the city’s “extreme temperatures.” Swift took the stage again the following two nights to finish out that leg of the tour. During the Sunday, November 19, show, she sang “Bigger Than Whole Sky,” seemingly as a tribute to Ana Clara.

Swift’s fans have come together since the tragic death to crowdsource funds to help Ana Clara’s family with funeral arrangements.

"'For the first time since 2014, the Yankees are rostering a man named Jeter. Aaron Judge won’t have to worry about sharing his captaincy, though.

The Yankees claimed Jeter Downs off waivers from the Nationals on Tuesday, the team announced. The infielder, 25, is named after Yankees icon Derek Jeter.

“Jeter was one of my favorite players growing up, just the way he carried himself, on and off the field,” Downs, who was born in Colombia but moved to Miami at a young age, told MLB.com in 2018. “He was never in trouble, he was a good role model to look up to as a kid growing up.”

Once a top prospect like his namesake, Downs hasn’t had much success as a pro so far.

He’s appeared in 20 major league games for the Red Sox and Nationals, hitting .182 with one homer — which came off Gerrit Cole at Yankee Stadium — and five RBI since 2022. Downs has hit just .238 with 76 homers, 254 RBI and 116 stolen bases over 529 minor league games.

He hit .236 over 51 games for Washington’s Triple-A affiliate last year.

The Yankees are now the fifth team to employ Downs. The Reds used a first-round pick on him in 2017, but they traded him to the Dodgers in December 2018. Los Angeles then sent Downs, Alex Verdugo and Connor Wong to the Red Sox for Mookie Betts and David Price in February 2020.

The Yankees recently acquired Verdugo from the Red Sox, meaning two-thirds of Boston’s return for Betts now wears pinstripes.

The Nationals claimed Downs off waivers from the Red Sox nearly one year ago.

Downs has one minor league option remaining, according to FanGraphs. Now a part of the Yankees’ 40-man roster, he joins a group of young infielders that includes Anthony Volpe, Oswald Peraza, Oswaldo Cabrera and Jorbit Vivas, another recent addition.

"'Using a combination of survey data and laboratory studies, NOAA Fisheries scientists identified starvation as the most likely cause of mass mortality event during the eastern Bering Sea marine heatwave.

In 2022, the Alaska snow crab fishery was closed for the first time in history due to a sudden, dramatic decline in adult and juvenile crabs. Scientists now believe the most likely cause of the decline was starvation and other factors linked to the 2018-2019 marine heatwave.

“During the marine heatwave, snow crabs faced a triple threat,” said lead author and Alaska Fisheries Science Center stock assessment scientist Cody Szuwalski. “Their metabolism increased, so they needed more food; their habitat was reduced so there was less area to forage; and crabs caught in our survey weighed less than usual. These conditions likely set them up for the dramatic decline we saw in 2021.”

The mortality event appears to be one of the largest reported losses due to marine heatwaves among the groups of animals that include fish and crustaceans globally.

Crab Abundance: Historic High to Record Low

In 2015, NOAA Fisheries scientists reported seeing a record number of juvenile snow crabs during their annual research survey in the eastern Bering Sea.

But just 3 years later that picture had changed. Between 2018 and 2019, the abundance of juvenile snow crabs declined by roughly half. By 2021, the survey found the fewest snow crab on the eastern Bering Sea shelf since the survey began in 1975. More than 10 billion crab disappeared from this region in the period 2018 to 2021.

Snow crab is one of the most abundant species in the bottom-dwelling ecosystem of the eastern Bering Sea. It supports an important commercial fishery, generating an average $150 million annually from 2012 to 2021. In 2021, 59 boats fished for snow crabs and brought $219 million into fishing communities.

As a result of the population decline, the state of Alaska subsequently announced the closure of the commercial snow crab fishery for the 2022–2023 season.

St. Paul, Alaska, home to the largest processing plant for crab in the world, was hit hard. A largely Indigenous community, St. Paul is highly dependent on the snow crab fishery. As a result of the fishery closure, Saint Paul declared a cultural, economic, and social emergency.

The Secretary of Commerce announced Disaster Declarations 2022–2023, which afforded some disaster relief funds to fishing communities.

The Looming Question: What Caused the Snow Crab Decline?

In this study, scientists considered factors that cause mortality such as:

Directed fishing

Bycatch in commercial trawls

Cannibalism

Predation from Pacific cod

Disease

Increased temperatures

In particular, they didn’t see a strong connection between variability in snow crab mortality, and predation and bycatch.

Pacific cod predation was near average levels during the collapse. For half of 2018, a large fraction of the cod population moved out of the eastern Bering Sea into the northern Bering Sea— a rare occurrence. This movement may have decreased the already average predation on snow crabs.The missing snow crabs were also larger than cod normally eat.

Scientists also ruled out bycatch as a significant factor in the snow crab decline for a couple of reasons. Trawling activity in the Bering Sea has been relatively consistent over the last two decades. The observed bycatch of snow crab by trawlers was actually much lower than historical levels. The largest group of young crab in history was observed in surveys and grew on the sea shelf for about eight years under consistent trawling pressure before the collapse.

“All of these factors cause some mortality, but only temperature and population size could explain the increase in mortality during the heatwave on such a scale in our models. High temperatures and large population sizes suggest starvation was a likely cause of the decline,” said Szuwalski.

Snow Crab Metabolism Speeds Up with Warmer Water Temperatures

NOAA Fisheries scientists have observed ocean temperatures over the 40-year history of their annual bottom trawl survey of the eastern Bering Sea. In 2018 and 2019, they observed ocean temperatures that were well above average. This marine heatwave was associated with die-offs of a number of species including ice-associated seals and seabirds.

Despite these unprecedented marine heatwave conditions, ocean temperatures were still within the upper extent of what snow crab could tolerate. But, scientists suspect that the warmer water temperatures affected snow crab metabolism.

Scientists, through lab tests, demonstrated that snow crab metabolism increases under rising water temperatures. For example, the caloric requirements for snow crab in the lab nearly doubled in water temperatures ranging from 0 to 3 degrees Celsius. This is roughly the change experienced by immature crab in the eastern Bering Sea from 2017 to 2018.

Prey Limitations and Reduced Habitat Likely Affected Snow Crab Condition and Survival

Data collected during research surveys on the weight of various ages of juvenile snow crab support the hypothesis that young crab were not getting enough to eat. In 2017, a crab with a 75-millimeter-wide shell weighed 156 grams on average. In 2018, this same size crab was roughly 25 grams lighter, weighing around 104 grams— a 15 percent decline in body weight.

Scientists also looked at the size of the area where the snow crabs were captured during their 2018 research survey. They noted that the crab was being caught in a smaller area than normal—the smallest relative to historic habitat in the history of the survey.

“The unprecedented caloric demands coupled with a small area from which to forage relative to historical grounds provide more evidence to support the model conclusions that starvation likely played a key role in the snow crab decline. This event mirrors what happened to Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska in 2016 during a marine heatwave,” said Mike Litzow, director, Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s Kodiak Lab. “We also suspect some cannibalism was occurring given the overlap between adult and juvenile crabs in the same small area.”

Adapting to Changing Ocean Conditions

Brian Garber-Yates is an economist from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center and another co-author on the paper. He suggests that resource managers’ best defense against continued warming conditions and future marine heatwaves is to enable the fishing industry to diversify.

There are a number of ways managers can respond to changing crab and fish stock abundance, including:

Improving efficiency in the distribution of disaster relief funds

Providing increased flexibility to allow fishermen to pursue diverse portfolios of species

Ensuring consistent and timely biological surveys

Supporting the development of alternative marine-based livelihoods, such as mariculture

Scientists can help, too, by providing timely data and information and near-term and future projections to help managers and fishermen better anticipate and plan for what lies ahead. Modeling projects and continued delivery of ecosystem information, which aid our understanding of how the changing environment is impacting marine resources, are instrumental in this effort. Some of these resources include ACLIM and GOACLIM, part of NOAA Fisheries Climate-Ready Fisheries Initiative, and Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s ecosystem status reports.

“Current management tools base projected sustainable yields of fish catches on the historical dynamics of a population,” said Szuwalski. “However, projections based on historical dynamics are not reliable when the future of a region doesn’t resemble the past.""

"'Troy Gray and Danny Worrell, J.R. Tucker High School graduates who went on to stand out at UR, are members of the eight-person ACC officiating crew assigned to the title game. Both live in the Richmond area.

Worrell will be the umpire and Gray will be the head linesman when the winners of Alabama-Michigan (Rose Bowl) and Texas-Washington (Sugar Bowl) meet in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game.

Gray and Worrell began in this profession by working games as members of the Central Virginia Football Officials Association, whose members officiate high school games. A third alum of that organization, Mike McCarthy, who is not originally from the Richmond area but has resided there for several years, is also a member of the title-game crew.

Tyrone Hicks, the commissioner of the Central Virginia Football Officials Association for five years and an officiating member for 36 years, said all three of those officials first distinguished themselves through performance in high school games held in the Richmond area.

“They are mentors currently to a lot of the officials that (work high school games), and we are very, very proud of them, absolutely,” Hicks said Wednesday. “They’ll come in and they’ll talk to the (high school officials) and they’ll tell them what it takes to get up to the next level, the dedication that’s required.”

Worrell and Gray have experience officiating bowl games.

The ACC was designated as the Power Five league to supply an officiating crew for the national championship game because the ACC does not have a team in the College Football Playoff this year. The Alabama-Michigan game will be called by a Big 12 crew and the Texas-Washington will be called by a Big Ten crew.

Officiating crew assignments for the 2023-24 bowl season were listed by footballzebras.com, which focuses on NFL and NCAA officiating. Each conference has its own criteria for determining officials assigned to a bowl game, per footballzebras.com.

According to Gray, his superiors advised that he and Worrell not speak to the media about the prestigious assignment prior to completion of the national championship game.

Worrell, a former Spiders’ offensive lineman, and Gray, a former Spiders’ linebacker, played at Richmond during the mid-1980s. Worrell was a UR captain in 1984, the year the Spiders advanced to the FCS playoffs for the first time, went 8-4, and finished ranked No. 12. Gray was a UR captain in 1986.

Worrell began officiating high school games in 1986, and his involvement drew Gray to the stripes. They occasionally worked on the same crew during their days as high school officials. Gray began officiating college football in the Division III Old Dominion Athletic Conference in 1996 and then the Atlantic 10 Conference (now CAA Football) in 1999. He worked Big East Conference games before joining the ACC in 2008.

Worrell took a very similar officiating path, spending a decade as a member of the Central Virginia Football Officials Association, then moving to D-III, and CAA Football before elevating to the Big East in 2002, and the ACC in 2004.

“To me, it’s a great reflection on the association and the work that we put into it, to try to produce quality officials,” Hicks said of the three Richmond representatives from the Central Virginia Football Officials Association.

According to Hicks, Gray, Worrell and McCarthy thoroughly understand football and “all three of them are very calm under pressure. Nothing rattles these guys, nothing at all.”

The Central Virginia Football Officials Association continues to seek officials for high school competition. The lack of officials is among the reasons many high school games this year were played on Thursday and Friday nights, so there would be enough officials for all games.

“Currently we’re at 140, and prior to the pandemic we were at 215,” Hicks said. “In order to get back to just Friday night football, we would need at least an additional 40 people.”

RENO, Nev. (AP) — Nevada has named Jeff Choate its new head football coach, the school announced Monday.

Choate had been co-defensive coordinator and inside linebackers coach at Texas since 2021. This season, the Longhorn defense ranks third nationally in rushing defense, fourth in red zone defense and 13th in scoring defense. Choate helped the Longhorns win the Big 12 title and reach the College Football Playoff.

Prior to his time at Texas, Choate went 28-22 in four years as Montana State head coach. In his final two years, his teams made consecutive appearances in the FCS playoffs, including a run to the semifinals in 2019.

Choate also has been an assistant at Florida, Washington State, Boise State, Eastern Illinois and Utah State.

“Jeff Choate is the right person at a very important moment in Wolf Pack football’s long history to lead our program into the future,"" Nevada president Brian Sandoval said. “Coach Choate has excelled at all levels as a coach, with a proven record in building successful college football programs.”

"'The tennis season this year has been full of ups and downs. For the first time in decades, the sport spent the vast majority of an entire year without seeing either Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal taking to the court. Young bucks stepped up to try and take their place, and old heads like Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were still around to entertain. It's been a great season, and there is one more event left to cap it all off. The ATP finals will begin this Sunday and run for a week, as we determine the winner of this year's tour.

But, how do you go about watching it? Well, if you're in North America, that might be a little tricky. You can opt for a paid option, like the Tennis Channel. Or, you can stick with this article, and find out how to catch all the action for free.

What is the ATP Tour?

The ATP Tour, or the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour, is a professional men's tennis circuit. It is organized by the ATP, which is the governing body for the men's professional tennis worldwide. The ATP Tour includes a series of tournaments held throughout the year, with players earning ranking points based on their performance in these events.

The tournaments on the ATP Tour vary in terms of their significance and the number of ranking points awarded. The most prestigious events are the Grand Slam tournaments: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Other significant tournaments include the ATP Tour Masters 1000 series and the ATP Tour 500 series.

The ATP Tour provides a platform for male tennis players to compete at the highest level and accumulate ranking points to determine their standings in the ATP Rankings. The top-ranked players often receive direct entry into major tournaments, and the rankings also play a role in determining seedings for these events. The ATP Tour contributes to the overall development and promotion of professional men's tennis globally.

This year's final will be taking place in Turin, Italy, and will last for one week.

"'ZURICH — Special prosecutors in Switzerland have closed criminal proceedings against FIFA President Gianni Infantino relating to undisclosed meetings with the country’s former attorney general.

Infantino had meetings with Michael Lauber in 2016, soon after being elected FIFA president, during a sweeping investigation of international soccer in Switzerland and by the U.S. Department of Justice. Media reports said another meeting was held in 2017.

Both Infantino and Lauber claimed they did not recall details of the meetings.

Lauber lost his job as the top Swiss federal prosecutor in 2020 in the fallout from the Infantino meetings, after being found to have misled and obstructed an oversight office monitoring federal prosecutors.

The first special prosecutor, Stefan Keller, was later removed by a federal court after Infantino formally complained of bias.

Weder and Maurer took over the case and questioned Infantino in January after his return to Switzerland from the World Cup in Qatar.

They said Thursday the case has been discontinued with no charges brought.

In a triumphalist statement, FIFA said it took note “with extreme satisfaction” of the decision of the prosecutors.

“The outcome of this investigation is obviously entirely unsurprising,” the governing body said. “The only surprising element is only the long time taken to reach such an obvious conclusion.”

Infantino said it was a “full and clear victory for me, for the new FIFA and for justice.”'",sports,soccer
"'Michigan Wolverines head coach Jim Harbaugh appears to still be considering a potential return to the NFL amid his team's berth in the College Football Playoff Final, according to ESPN NFL insider and University of Michigan alum Adam Schefter.

Harbaugh, who played quarterback at Michigan and in the NFL and coached the San Francisco 49ers before returning to his alma mater in 2015, hasn't signed a reported 10-year, $125 million contract extension that would make him college football's highest-paid coach and recently hired agent Don Yee, who has not ties to the NFL.

""Let's just look at it in basic facts,"" Schefter said during an appearance on 'the Pat McAfee Show' while wearing a Michigan shirt. ""He's hired an agent, Don Yee, who has deep NFL connections. He's got Michigan one game away from a national championship. Whether or not he wins it, I believe the NFL will help dictate or determine whether or not he goes.

""If there's a team out there that really wants him, that makes a really compelling offer, my sense is that he would be interested, absolutely, in listening and entertaining that offer no matter what happens [during the College Football Playoff National Championship Final] next Monday night. That's my opinion.""'",sports,football
"'Kahleah Copper hasn’t lacked bulletin-board material as she has moved up in her WNBA career.

When the guard/forward was tapped for her first starting role with the Sky in 2020 after four seasons in the league, skeptics questioned whether she belonged. She responded with career highs in every statistical category, only for naysayers to wonder whether she could do it again.

The next season, she not only made it happen but was left holding the WNBA Finals MVP trophy as confetti rained down at Wintrust Arena.

This offseason, after the Sky’s first-round playoff elimination by the two-time champion Aces, the three-time All-Star’s fire is being fueled by her omission from both All-WNBA teams and by a new coach, Teresa Weatherspoon, who was hired last month.

“Seeing the All-WNBA teams, why rest?” Copper said.

For a second straight year, she has opted not to play overseas, but that in no way means she’s relaxing. After the Sky’s postseason exit, her individual workouts began. And this week, she rejoined the U.S. women’s national team for training camp and exhibition games coming up Sunday against Tennessee and Nov. 12 against Duke as staff evaluate the player pool ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. Copper won a gold medal with the group in 2022 at the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup in Australia.

As she keeps chasing new firsts, she now has Weatherspoon squarely in her corner.

“We connected over energy,” Copper said. “I’ve never had a coach that could really match my energy. That was something that really hit me.”

And Weatherspoon’s expectations for her star player go much further than an All-WNBA team.

“The energy is there,” Weatherspoon told the Sun-Times at her official introduction. “[Copper] can do so many things. She is so gifted in so many ways. As tough as she is and as good as she is, she could very well have her name spoken as an MVP candidate.”

Last season, Copper showed she’s capable of shouldering the load, averaging a career-best 18.7 points and leading the Sky to an 18-22 record and a fifth straight postseason appearance. But those results weren’t satisfying, and Copper has new confidence in the Sky’s direction after front-office additions that included Nadia Rawlinson as operating chairman and co-owner in January and Jeff Pagliocca as general manager on Tuesday.

“We talk about the vision and what we want to do, and everybody has to be on board,” Copper said. “Everybody has to hold each other accountable to be able to get to that vision. Having former players who have done it at the highest level really helps.”

That includes not just Weatherspoon, a two-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, but former NBA great Dwyane Wade, who joined the Sky ownership group this summer.

In seven seasons with the team, Copper has seen three coaching changes, the dismantling of a championship roster and now a rebuild. She acknowledged there’s a different feeling this time with these changes and promises from ownership about more to come.

“[When] we talk about player experience, what’s important and what we need to be successful, they know,” Copper said of Weatherspoon, Rawlinson and Wade. “So, it’s a different look and it’s a different mindset. Like ’Spoon said, we’re saying, ‘Gear up,’ and we mean everybody. It’s not just the players. It’s ownership. Everybody has to step to another level.”

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

The NFL's first Black Friday game: The league is going big on Thanksgiving this year with three games, followed by its first-ever Black Friday game. The NFL still has high hopes that extending its coverage into Black Friday will also extend the ratings.

Hello, my name is Joshua Dobbs. If you follow the Cleveland Browns, you'll recall the team's training camp backup quarterback was 28-year-old journeyman QB Joshua Dobbs. The Browns traded Dobbs to the Arizona Cardinals in August, where he served as the team's starter while franchise QB Kyler Murray rehabbed from injury. On October 31, Dobbs was traded to the Minnesota Vikings. Six days later, he was on the field after the Vikings starter left the game with a concussion. Dobbs led the Vikings to a win over the Atlanta Falcons despite having not practiced with, or learned the names of, his teammates. Dobbs became the first quarterback in NFL history with consecutive three-touchdown games for different teams and continues to start for the Vikings.

Good morning, Baltimore. Many hours of NFL sports broadcasts over recent years have been dedicated to arguing the talents (or lack thereof) of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Lamar has always been a dynamic scrambler out of the pocket, but pundits (and Bengals fans) like to argue that Lamar runs the ball too often. The Ravens are 8-3 coming into Week 12 and MVP chants follow Lamar (again) at every turn. Jackson has five rushing touchdowns this season, which has no doubt fueled the fire.

"'SAN JOSE — Branham turned in another robust offensive performance Friday in a 35-28 win over Silver Creek to clinch no worse than a share of the Blossom Valley Athletic League Santa Teresa-Foothill Division title.

The 35 points scored against Silver Creek was the fewest Branham has scored in any of its seven wins. The Bruins (7-2, 4-0) are averaging 44 points per game on the season, 51.7 points per game in their seven victories.

It’s a testament to our commitment to our philosophy year-round,” Branham coach Stephen Johnson said. “Offensive coordinator Tommy McMahon does a great job of developing quarterbacks. He was the quarterback here in 2012 and just like me got into coaching right out of high school. We’ve really grown up in this program together, starting in our early 20s, late teens.”

The win guaranteed Branham a spot in the Central Coast Section playoffs. Branham lost in the CCS Division IV championship game a year ago, 23-15 to Santa Teresa..

“We’re happy to be back,” Johnson said. “After a tough loss last year in the final, I think this group really wants a chance at redemption. They think about it and talk about it all the time.”

Branham, with its balanced attack, amassed 488 yards of total offense against Silver Creek, 253 rushing and 235 passing.

“Branham is a really good football team,” Silver Creek coach Eric Luescher said. “The guys were just gassed trying to defend their hurry-up. They put together a good plan for us.”

Jack Lewis completed 20 of 28 passes for 235 yards. He threw for two touchdowns and ran for another.

Running back Elias Antillion, all 140 pounds of him, carried 31 times for 163 yards. He ran for two TDs and caught a pass for a third score. A running back his size is most often utilized running away from traffic on the perimeter. But as his 31 carries indicate, Branham used him as a workhorse feature back, sending him up the middle, just as often as to the outside.

“I’ve always been an under-sized running back and I’ve always had to prove myself to other teams and even to my own team,” Antillion said. “I can run up the middle when a lot of people are saying, ‘why is that little kid running up the middle?’ I feel I can run the ball as good as one 100 pounds heavier than me.”

Branham took the opening kickoff and went 80 yards in 11 plays with Lewis connecting with Preston Conrad on a 27-yard touchdown pass. Conrad finished with a game-high six catches for 83 yards.

Silver Creek tied it later in the first quarter on a 56-yard run by Gabriel Lim on a fourth-and-three play.

Antillion scored two touchdowns in the second quarter, on a 21-yard pass from Lewis and on a 2-yard run, as Branham took a 21-7 lead at halftime. His third TD, another 2-yard run, made it 35-14 with just under 10 minutes left.

Silver Creek had zero yards passing in the first half, but QB Trajan Sinatra threw three touchdown passes to Austin Price in the second half, including a 7-yarder with 3:17 left that brought the Raiders within 35-28. However an onside kick was recovered by the Bruins and they ran the clock out on the ground with Antillion carrying on five of their seven remaining plays.

Lim, Silver Creek’s top offensive performer with 133 yards rushing on 13 carries, left the game with a separated shoulder after a 32-yard run in the fourth quarter to set up a Sinatra-to-Price touchdown.

“I give a lot of credit to the boys,” Luescher said. “They showed character and kept fighting until the end.”

Now Silver Creek (6-3, 3-1) needs to win Thursday at Independence to assure itself of gaining the division’s second automatic bid to the CCS playoffs.

“It will be a challenge coming off a game like this and with a short week,” Luescher said. “We’ll get in here tomorrow morning, do some stretching and lifting and start getting ready for Thursday.”'",sports,football

"'Rafael Nadal marked his singles comeback after being out injured for nearly a year with a convincing 7-5 6-1 victory over Austrian former world number three Dominic Thiem in the Brisbane International first round.

The 22-times grand slam champion had arthroscopic surgery last June after injuring his left hip flexor during his second round defeat by Mackenzie McDonald at the Australian Open in early 2023.

Nadal returned to competitive tennis in the new season on Sunday and crashed to a doubles defeat while partnering retired veteran Marc Lopez but showed glimpses of his top form ahead of the first grand slam of the season.

The 37-year-old looked razor sharp again during his latest meeting with qualifier Thiem in a rematch of their 2018 and 2019 French Open finals which he won, as he ramped up the pressure and claimed the opening set with a break.

Roared on by fans inside a heaving Pat Rafter Arena, Nadal grabbed an early break in the second set with a superb backhand pass and barely looked back as he racked up a 5-1 lead before closing out the match on serve.

The former British No 1, who was playing her first match since April following operations on both her wrists and one ankle, held off a fightback from the Romanian qualifier to progress 6-3 4-6 7-5.

Her preparations for the upcoming Australian Open will continue with a tough last-16 tie against second seed Elina Svitolina.

The winning moment

10:56 , Ben Fleming

It was a comprehensive win in that second set. Here’s the winning point for the Spaniard:

Rafa is back.

Nadal speaking after his win

10:47 , Ben Fleming

“Today is an emotional and important day after one of the toughest years of my tennis career. I played at a very positive level for my first day [back] and that will make me, my team and my family feel proud - they have been there every single day during the last year.

“The first set was very equal with both of us serving well. Then I was able to grab that break at 6-5 so that made a difference. I know Dominic has been going through some hard times with injuries too so I’m happy to see him back on court and I wish him all the very best for the season.

“I missed being healthy, feeling myself competitive and playing in front of full crowds like this. I can’t thank enough everyone.”

Nadal 7-5 6-1 Thiem

10:43 , Ben Fleming

Thiem looked good in that first set but fell away significantly in that second set as errors crept into his game. Rafa, meanwhile, looked imperious on his serve and took the opportunities that were presented to him in a clinical fashion.

GAME, SET, MATCH! Nadal 7-5 6-1 Thiem

10:39 , Ben Fleming

Another ball flies long for Thiem as Nadal takes the opening point of this must-win game for Thiem. And it’s a poor shot again from the Austrian, netting his return to Rafa’s second serve to move the Spaniard 30-0 up.

A first double fault of the game from Nadal might give Thiem a slight opening but it’s just the sixth point he’s lost on serve and is quickly followed by a superb serve out wide to bring up two match points.

He only needs one! Thiem is sent sprawling all over the court and Nadal simply has to dink the ball over the net to conclude a resounding second set and claim victory on his return after a year-long layoff.

Remarkable tennis from the Spaniard!

*Nadal 7-5 5-1 Thiem

10:35 , Ben Fleming

Another pair of unforced error from Thiem sees the game finely poised at 30-30 on the Austrian’s serve. And an amazing return from Nadal follows which cramps Thiem up for room and brings up another chance for the Spaniard to break...

And he takes it! Not much emotion from Rafa but he moves into a commanding position after another unforced error from Thiem.

Nadal now serving for the match.

Nadal 7-5 4-1 Thiem*

10:29 , Ben Fleming

The first testing moment for Nadal, now, on serve as Thiem moves 30-15 up. A slight opening with Nadal stranded on the left side of the court but Thiem finds the net with an attempted down-the-line backhand winner.

Could that be costly? Indeed, it is as Nadal recovers well to hold serve and move just two games away from his first victory in a year.

*Nadal 7-5 3-1 Thiem

10:25 , Ben Fleming

The Austrian is on the board at last in this second set as a loose game from Nadal finally arrives. We expected a lot more of that in this match but it’s been a steller display so far from the Spaniard.

Nadal 7-5 3-0 Thiem*

10:20 , Ben Fleming

Thiem looking a bit perplexed with himself after another return flies long. Nadal races into a 40-0 lead on serve and consolidates the break in emphatic style as Thiem’s slice finds the net.

Five games in a row now for the returning Spaniard who is racing to the finish line now.

*Nadal 7-5 2-0 Thiem

10:17 , Ben Fleming

Thiem’s third double fault of the game gives Nadal a 15-30 lead but it’s a tidy response from the Austrian to level it up at 30-30 with a booming first serve.

Well, now here’s a chance as Thiem goes long with an unforced error. An early break-point opportunity for Nadal...and taken in superb style! Thiem comes forward to the net but a whipping cross-court backhand evades the outstretched racquet of Thiem and Nadal strikes early to take a 2-0 lead in this second set.

Nadal 7-5 1-0 Thiem*

10:12 , Ben Fleming

A few mistakes starting to creep into Thiem’s game - his team will want to ensure that his head doesn’t drop after losing that first set just then. It’s a comfortable start for Nadal in this second set, though, as he holds to love to move 1-0 up.

Nadal 7-5 Thiem

10:05 , Ben Fleming

Another chance for Nadal as the backhand forces Thiem wide but again the World No. 98 holds firm to save another break point with a superb cross-court winner after a serve out wide.

But a double fault follows! The worst possible time and Nadal now has a third set point...saved again, though. Great courage to serve down the line there after his double fault just moments ago.

Chance number four coming up now for Nadal as the Spaniard fires a superb pass with Thiem at the net and this time he takes it as Thiem pushes his shot long. Superb from Nadal who claims his first set on return from injury!

Nadal 6-5 Thiem*

10:01 , Ben Fleming

Now, is this the chance?! A crisp, flat backhand is arrowed into the corner as Nadal takes a 0-30 lead on Thiem’s serve for the first time this match.

A poor return of Nadal follows as a wry smile appears on the Spaniard’s face. It’s followed up superbly by Thiem who crunches a whipping forehand winner past Nadal to get back to 30-30.

But what a point to follow! The Spaniard is motoring and backpedalling all over the court and brings up his first break point of the game as Thiem finds the net. A chance to claim the first set...but not to be. A half chance as Thiem comes forward to the net but Nadal can’t execute the pass and it’s deuce.

A crucial few minutes in this match.

Nadal 6-5 Thiem*

09:55 , Ben Fleming

Another comfortable hold of serve for Nadal as the Spaniard rips a forehand down the line to claim his sixth game of the first set. Thiem now looks to hold serve, too, and send us to a first-set tie-break.

*Nadal 5-5 Thiem

09:51 , Ben Fleming

Thiem has certainly not been overawed by his opponent across the court at any point so far today. Some more sublime Tennis from the Austrian moves him 40-0 up and another pin-point forehand down the line brings him back level with Nadal at 5-5.

Nadal 4-4 Thiem*

09:47 , Ben Fleming

A big winner from Thiem to start the game but a great response from Nadal and the first real signs of emotion as he pumps his first after his deft backhand volley levels it up at 15-15.

That will get the crowd going! The Spaniard opens up his body and puts every bit of energy into a ripping forehand which flies down the line and past Thiem. This match is really starting to crank up now.

Thiem almost clocks Nadal with a passing effort as he pulls it back to 40-30 but an ace from Nadal means we still haven’t reached deuce yet in this first set.

*Nadal 4-4 Thiem

09:42 , Ben Fleming

Not much Nadal can do there as Thiem serves out wide before thundering a vicious forehand into the opposite corner. The Spaniard is chasing dust once again as Thiem smashes a volley past the Spaniard to move 40-15 up in this game.

Nadal goes long with his second-serve return and that’s the game. All level at 4-4.

Nadal 4-3 Thiem*

09:38 , Ben Fleming

Some errors follow from Thiem on the background, allowing Nadal to race through his service game to love. Precious few opportunities to break have presented themselves to either player so far this set and we are closing in on a tie-break to decide this first set.

*Nadal 3-3 Thiem

09:33 , Ben Fleming

It’s looking good for Thiem, too, on serve as he moves 40-15 after the first real unforced error from Nadal so far in this match sees a good opportunity on his forehand fly long and out of court.

It’s into the net with the next return of serve as Thiem levels it up at 3-3.

Nadal 3-2 Thiem*

09:28 , Ben Fleming

It’s all looking very routine for Nadal on serve so far. Some great hands get the better of his opponent up at the net as he edges ahead again once more in this first set.

*Nadal 2-2 Thiem

09:24 , Ben Fleming

A nice touch from Thiem around the net, now, as he executes a drop shot to perfection to leave Nadal stranded on the baseline.

40-15 up now for Thiem on serve but it’s wonderful movement from Nadal on return! Great defensive work from the Spaniard and his whipping cross-court forehand wrongfoots Nadal and brings it back to 40-30.

Thiem sees it out, though, at the net to take the game but more pleasing signs for Nadal fans, without a doubt.

Nadal 2-1 Thiem*

09:19 , Ben Fleming

It’s a fast, responsive court here in Brisbane which appears to be helping Nadal in these early stages as he goes 30-0 up.

Now he’s up to the net and that’s a superb touch! It didn’t look like Nadal would get there but it’s a deft flick over the net, sending Thiem the wrong way and claiming the point. He serves out to make it eight from eight on service so far.

A strong start for the Spaniard.

*Nadal 1-1 Thiem

09:15 , Ben Fleming

Not a bad start, either, for Thiem on serve as a lovely forehand sees him take an early 30-0 lead on service but he has no response to a thunderous Nadal forehand which brings it back to 30-15.

A good response, though, from the Austrian who fires down two big serves to level things up.

Nadal 1-0 Thiem*

09:11 , Ben Fleming

Well, that’s not a bad start! A thunderous flat forehand down the line penetrates the court and leaves Thiem helpless as Nadal claims the first point of the match.

Before long, he races into a 40-0 lead and as Thiem’s return goes long, it’s a comfortable and assured hold of serve to kick things off.

*Nadal 0-0 Thiem

09:09 , Ben Fleming

Rafa will serve first in this match and, with the warm-ups down, we are ready to get started in Brisbane...

Nadal vs Thiem

09:05 , Ben Fleming

Thiem should be the sharper of the two, not only because of Nadal’s lay-off but because he has had to come through two rounds of qualifying to reach this point. The Austrian saved matched points against Australia’s James McCabe before beating Giulio Zeppieri to reach the first round proper.

Nadal vs Thiem

09:01 , Ben Fleming

I’m careful to say return to singles action because, technically, Australia has already seen the Spaniard back in action a few days ago in the doubles tournament.

Nadal played alongside fellow countryman Marc Lopez but lost in straight sets to the Australian duo of Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson.

But here he comes now, returning to singles action as the crowd cheers him onto the court.

Next up for Raducanu

08:57 , Ben Fleming

There’s certainly no soft touch for Raducanu on her return to competition.

The Brit is into the second round but faces a difficult clash against No.2 seed and last year’s Wimbledon semi-finalist Elina Svitolina after the Ukrainian came through her clash against Caroline Wozniacki.

A tough ask but that’s for another day. Right now, we are back in Brisbane and awaiting the return of Rafa Nadal to singles action.

Raducana speaking after her win in Auckland

08:55 , Ben Fleming

“Thank you to everyone for coming out and staying late - I really appreciate the support. It was a match with ups and downs; it’s always difficult playing a friend but I love being back in Auckland and I’m having a blast so far.

“It’s difficult after having such a long hiatus but I’m grateful to be healthy and able to move my body; not bed-ridden or in a wheelchair so it’s pretty amazing to just be out here and playing. I’m just really happy to be back on tour and I can’t wait to start this season and carry on hopefully injury-free and healthy.”

Game, set match Raducanu!

08:50 , Ben Fleming

Ruse 3-6 6-4 5-7 Raducanu

But over in Auckland, it’s victory for Raducana who wins for her first time back on the court in eight months! The Brit was 0-30 down on serve in that final game but a great comeback in that game saw her finally get over the line after more than two hours on court.

Nadal vs Thiem head-to-head

08:45 , Ben Fleming

The Spaniard is still waiting to take the court in Brisbane but he’ll have a tough time today against Dominic Thiem, who himself has had his well-documented issues with injury. The pair have faced each other 15 times on the ATP circuit with the Spaniard leading 9-6.

The Austrian has, however, won both their last two meetings - at the 2020 ATP Finals in Turin and at the quarterfinals in the 2020 Australian Open.

Another break for Raducanu

08:41 , Ben Fleming

Ruse 3-6 6-4 5-6 Raducanu*

What a response! Ruse has produced some thunderous tennis in these last few games but Raducana has stood firm and backed her ability. Some sturdy defence forces mistakes from Ruse and, this time, Raducana capitalises to claim yet another break.

Can she serve out to win the match at the third time of asking now?

Two chances go begging for Raducanu

08:37 , Ben Fleming

Ruse 3-6 6-4 5-5 Raducanu*

The first chance to serve out for the match went begging for Raducanu but she has another chance here on serve.

At 30-30, Ruse thunders a forehand winner across the court and now she has another break point to tie up the match...and the Romanian does!

Level at 5-5 from 5-2 down - work to do for Raducanu.

Andy Murray beaten by Grigor Dimitrov in battle at Brisbane International

08:28 , Ben Fleming

Andy Murray’s preparations for the Australian Open suffered a setback following a frustrating first-round loss to second seed Grigor Dimitrov at the Brisbane International.

The unseeded Scot was on course to advance after taking the opening set of a tense battle between two former tournament champions on Pat Rafter Arena.

But Dimitrov hit back to progress 4-6 7-5 6-2 and inflict another early exit on Murray following his second-round victory when the pair met at last year’s US Open.

Also making a return

08:24 , Ben Fleming

It’s also a huge day for Emma Raducanu as the Brit makes her return to competition after almost eight months out.

The former US Open champion is currently in action against World No. 134 Gabriela Ruse and has just taken a huge step towards victory by securing a double break in the third and decisive set.

She won the first set 6-3 before Ruse levelled it up but the 21-year-old now leads 5-2 in the third and is serving for the match....

The season of comebacks

08:17 , Ben Fleming

This week it’s not just Nadal making his comeback to competitive tennis. Most notably in the woman’s game, former World No.1 Noami Osaka made a winning return to tennis as she beat Germany’s Tamara Korpatsch 6-3 7-6 in the first round of the Brisbane International.

The former world number one has not played since withdrawing from the Pan Pacific Trophy with a knee injury in September 2021. She became a mother for the first time in July.

Four-time grand slam champion Osaka returned to the court in style, breaking Korpatsch to love in the first game and did not face a break point as she clinched the first set in 39 minutes.

Osaka looked set for a routine victory when she broke for a 5-3 lead in the second set, but Korpatsch fought back to take it into a tie-break – Osaka winning 11-9 on her third match point.

More from Nadal:

“It’s obvious it’s a high percentage that it’s going to be my last time playing in Australia. But if I’m here next year, don’t tell me, ‘you said it’s going to be your last season’ because I didn’t say it,” said Nadal, a two-time winner of the Australian Open men’s singles title.

“You never know what’s going on, you know? I can’t predict how I’m going to be in the next six months. I can’t predict if my body will allow me to enjoy tennis as much as I enjoyed the past 20 years.”

What has Nadal said ahead of his comeback?

“I am feeling good. I can’t complain. I’m feeling much better today than what I expected a month ago.

“For me, it’s impossible to think about winning tournaments. But what’s really possible is to try to enjoy the comeback to the courts. I don’t expect much. Honestly, the only thing that I expect is to be able to go on court, to feel competitive and to give my best.

“It’s going to be a tough process at the beginning. At the end, it’s one year without being on the tennis court and I just have been practising for the last month in a very good intensity. I don’t say that nothing is impossible, but just to be here is a victory.”

Nadal vs Thiem LIVE: Latest updates as Spaniard makes tennis comeback

08:00 , Jamie Braidwood

Rafael Nadal makes his long-awaited return to singles action this morning as the 22-time grand slam champion takes on old rival Dominic Thiem in the opening round of the Brisbane International in Australia.

Nadal has been out since suffering a hip injury at the Australian Open last January - almost a year ago - and underwent surgery in June. The 37-year-old returned to doubles action on Sunday, alongside Marc Lopez, but lost 6-4 6-4 to the Australian duo of Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson.

But now the Spaniard switches his attention to the singles in what is a mouthwatering clash with 2020 US Open champion Thiem, who Nadal beat in the 2017 and 2018 French Open finals.

Nadal had previously said he expected to bring the curtains down on his glittering but injury-plagued career in 2024, but in a press conference ahead of his comeback at the Brisbane International he left the door ajar.

""The problem about saying it’s going to be my last season is that I can’t predict what’s going on 100 per cent in the future. That’s the thing,"" Nadal said. ""That’s why I say probably.""

"'BOSTON — The regulations directing how the state conserves water during various stages of drought do not encroach on water departments’ right to withdraw water from the state’s natural resources, a judge has ruled.

After the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection issued amended regulations in January 2023, a group of water departments — including five in the Pioneer Valley — challenged the new regulations in court, arguing the department lacked the authority to issue them and they were entitled to collect a certain amount of water a year.

But last week, Judge Catherine H. Ham of the Suffolk County Superior Court said the regulations were needed to ensure residents of the state had access to water and the natural resource was protected well into the future.

“The purpose of the Amended Regulations was to address the water shortage issue before a Water Emergency is declared and is more of a specific plan of conserving water rather than the drastic measure of banning and restricting any and all water uses,” Ham wrote in the 16-page decision.

The case was filed on Feb. 17, and was brought by 19 plaintiffs. They included the Springfield Water and Sewer Commission, Fall River Water Department, Amherst Water Department, South Hadley Fire District No.2 Water Department and Holyoke Water Works.

The group was represented by attorneys Peter F. Durning, John Shea, Jr. and Peter Vetere, of Burns and Levinson LLP. They claimed the state Department of Environmental Protection’s new regulatory provisions that relate to water withdrawal restrictions in times of drought were “unlawful and arbitrary and capricious.”

In the 1980s, the state legislature passed the Water Management Act that allowed water departments that withdrew more than 100,000 gallons a day to file a registration statement. They were then entitled to continue to withdraw the same volume every year, barring a state-declared water emergency.

The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection can declare a state of water emergency if there is a shortage of water severe enough to endanger public health, safety or welfare. During an emergency, the department can control the amount of water that is distributed to certain users, including stopping the withdrawal of water completely, Ham wrote.

At the beginning of 2023, the decision reads, the department issued some amended regulations that sought to manage “nonessential outdoor water use” during a declared drought. A mild drought would restrict nonessential water use to one day a week, excluding the watering of plants and gardens, which could be watered every day. A significant drought bans all nonessential outdoor water use, except for the watering of plants, and a critical drought or a drought emergency bans all nonessential outdoor water use.

The plaintiffs claimed the amended regulations infringed upon their entitlement to the withdrawal amount. They claimed that the nonessential use condition would limit their annual withdrawal because drought regions vary drastically from actual conditions present in the area served by some water departments.

The court ruled that although the plaintiffs were correct that the Department of Environmental Protection could not change their entitlement to existing withdrawals or lessen the existing yearly withdrawal volume, the legislature gave the department the ability to oversee water conservation and management.

The regulations were justly related to the goals of water conservation and had a purpose of establishing a more rational and specific plan of water conservation instead of banning and restricting any and all water uses.

The court also ruled that the water departments’ yearly withdrawal volume was not infringed upon because the regulations are only enacted during a drought, at which time all citizens are responsible for conserving water.

The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission, the Holyoke Water Works, Amherst Water Department and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection did not immediately return requests for comment.'",climate,drought
"'After weeks of infighting and turmoil that has left the U.S. House of Representatives without a speaker for 20 days, Republicans could elect the chamber’s next leader as soon as Tuesday — thanks in part to a Nebraska congressman.

Rep. Mike Flood, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District, including part of Sarpy County, unveiled a “unity pledge” late Friday in an effort to rally the House’s GOP members to back the party’s eventual speaker-designate, which the caucus will nominate through an internal election Tuesday.

All nine House Republicans who have launched campaigns for the speakership had signaled support for the pledge as of Monday evening, vowing to vote for the speaker-designate “regardless of who that candidate is” when they face an election on the House floor, which could come as soon as Tuesday.

In signing the pledge, the lawmakers also promised to vote for the party’s agreed-upon candidate “for as long as they remain” the speaker designate.

“We aren’t a majority unless we vote as a majority,” Flood told the Lincoln Journal Star on Monday. “Meaning there is no majority in Congress if we don’t vote together.

“I just felt like we need some unity.”

Reps. Austin Scott of Georgia, Pete Sessions of Texas, Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Jack Bergman of Michigan, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, Byron Donalds of Florida, Gary Palmer of Alabama and Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota signed Flood’s unity pledge. CNN reported that Meuser dropped out of the race Monday night.

“In a perfect world, we wouldn’t have to sign it, because this is the way it’s worked for 200 years — people accept the winner of the leadership election inside the conference,” Flood said in a phone interview.

Flood’s attempt to unify House Republicans comes after weeks of standstill in the chamber that, last week, prompted the Norfolk native to “wonder if Jesus Christ could get 217 votes in the Republican conference” as the caucus tried and failed to find a successor to Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the embattled former House speaker who saw his tenure as the chamber’s leader end earlier this month after eight House Republicans joined with Democrats to oust him.

House Republicans have since elected two nominees for the job, including Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio, but both were forced to withdraw their candidacies after it became clear that neither could secure the 217 votes needed to win the position.

Jordan peaked with 201 votes in his initial bid for the speakership early last week and lost support from within his own party in each of the next two votes.

Flood voted for both men when they faced votes on the House floor, including three times for Jordan, an ultraconservative hardliner who drew opposition from the party’s moderates, including Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska’s competitive 2nd Congressional District, who said his 2024 reelection bid did not steer his controversial votes against Jordan.

Now, Flood is angling to manufacture unity in a House with “very little party discipline” — familiar territory for Flood, who previously served as the speaker of Nebraska’s nonpartisan, single-body Legislature.

“I feel like the Unicameral has followed me out to Washington, D.C.,” Flood said. “I’m a fan of the Unicameral, but it doesn’t work when there’s 435 people and we’ve got the issues that we have right now. That’s why we have a two-party system. I just want to see everybody work together.”

The caucus will vote behind closed doors Tuesday to nominate its latest speaker-designate from the group of candidates, among whom Emmer, the No. 3 House Republican, is considered a front-runner. Donalds is the only nominee who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, members of which helped engineer McCarthy’s ouster earlier this month.

Flood said he expects the conference to hold an internal roll call vote after settling on a speaker designate via a secret ballot, making House Republicans indicate one way or another whether they intend to support the nominee once on the floor.

“I think that’s where we keep the door the locked and we don’t leave that room until we sort it out before we go to the floor,” he said. “That’s how I think this can get resolved.”

Flood said Monday afternoon he hadn’t yet decided who he would vote for as his party’s nominee for speaker, indicating he would wait to hear where all of the nine candidates stand on unity and “functioning as a majority.”

His spearheading of the unity pledge — which made national headlines over the weekend — made Flood the state’s second congressman to become a key figure in the House’s ongoing hunt for its next leader after Bacon emerged as a vocal roadblock to Jordan’s path to the speakership last week, drawing ire from right-wing critics both in Nebraska and nationally.

Still, Flood is clear-eyed about the power the written pledges for unity will or won’t have on the House floor, where his colleagues have been unable to find common ground — and unable to legislate — for the better part of a month.

“I think this pledge only helps,” he said. “I think the problems that I’ve seen inside the conference are that complex. I had a lot of hope that we would be able to unite last week and select a speaker. I don’t know what the mood is. But I do know I’d rather be talking about unity than a variety of other grievances that have been raised in the past.

“And I think that’s where the majority of the folks in the Republican conference are — they want to talk about unity, too, because this isn’t working for anyone.”
